       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it's just cgi fights after cgi fights.<br/><br/>What they don't get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.<br/><br/>This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It's all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.<br/><br/>And guess what? It works. Mostly.<br/><br/>Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we've seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder's sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing \"comic book to screen\" adaptation.<br/><br/>Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that's because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that's the one thing Michael Bay wouldn't approve, you don't disrespect the military like that!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).<br/><br/>And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.<br/><br/>This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.<br/><br/>But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of \"who is really a hero?\" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.<br/><br/>If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.<br/><br/>I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of \"Black Adam\". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn't take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it's a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn't stop... it's a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It's only problem - it's so average; something we've seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn't great, frankly. But it's still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!<br/><br/>So let's get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a \"twist\" near the middle of the film. It's not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who've seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn't try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it's more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to \"The Suicide Squad\" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say \"see look how brutal we can make this\" without actually earning the audience's investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with \"look how powerful and ruthless he is\". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!<br/><br/>It's when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan's Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that's okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I'd love to see this iteration of the character return. I'm just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson's physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn't here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn't like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad\" and of course a certain cast member from \"Shazam!\". I did love these little connections- it's nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the \"Shazam!\" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It's definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!<br/><br/>The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn't stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder's \"300\", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don't even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn't discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn't memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that's okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.<br/><br/>So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It's remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- \"Avatar\", \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like \"Venom\"... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson's \"Black Adam\", especially in a potential \"Black Adam v. Superman\" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.<br/><br/>This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.<br/><br/>There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.<br/><br/>I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Black Adam\" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019's \"Shazam!\". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam's rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.<br/><br/>Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character's sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical \"with great power comes great responsibility\" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.<br/><br/>I have to admit it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he's going to pick and choose.<br/><br/>To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there's extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It's just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.<br/><br/>As the film is a spin-off from \"Shazam!\", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there's also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn't always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.<br/><br/>It seems long overdue that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It's great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn't consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That's not to say he's always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate's comic debut predates Strange's creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn't have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there's any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.<br/><br/>Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like \"Black Adam\" doesn't really offer anything better or worse than what we've already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from \"Shazam!\", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.<br/><br/>I rate it 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.<br/><br/>The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.<br/><br/>It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.<br/><br/>My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.<br/><br/>As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just an average superhero movie with a 2005 vibe which was odd but let me tell you . Dr.fate is so fricken cool , best choice d.c had . They should've called it black rock because all you see is Dwayne roided up acting like Dwayne . Action is non stop pretty much so it doesn't fail on that part . Story is kinda meh , typical dc writing . Atom , well there's going to be a lot of comparisons to Deadpool per say . It's a fun popcorn movie check it out, expecially for the casuals who don't know much about black Adam . I think the comic nerds might not like a lot of it but that's okay . This movie is not for everyone but if you're looking for a good time , this movie definitely hits that spot.</div>\n",

Action packed from start to finish. Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.<br/><br/>This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.<br/><br/>At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.<br/><br/>So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.<br/><br/>More on that later.<br/><br/>A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.<br/><br/>There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.<br/><br/>These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.<br/><br/>To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.<br/><br/>2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.<br/><br/>Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.</div>\n",

I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud &amp; messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.<br/><br/>That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.<br/><br/>The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.<br/><br/>That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.<br/><br/>Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.<br/><br/>This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.<br/><br/>I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.<br/><br/>Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.</div>\n",

Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.<br/><br/>Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.<br/><br/>Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.<br/><br/>Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?<br/><br/>Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.<br/><br/>This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.<br/><br/>For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.</div>\n",

Literally poor direction , most of place felt rushed , clumsy and incomplete . Action sequence was topnotch , with good choreography and marvelous visuals . Humor worked well in few places . More than Black Adam we can only see Dwayne Johnson . Comparing to others Doctor Fate was pretty impressive . Antagonist didn't create much impact . Cast done their job well . Technically , VFXs and cinematography were good , editing was average .<br/><br/>Overall a jus watch it for action sequence and mid credit scene 🔥 , if you can digest some cringe .</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?<br/><br/>Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.<br/><br/>If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).<br/><br/>It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.<br/><br/>The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.<br/><br/>It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.<br/><br/>It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.<br/><br/>Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.<br/><br/>Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.<br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.<br/><br/>The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.<br/><br/>And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.<br/><br/>It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.</div>\n",

Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.<br/><br/>Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.<br/><br/>Solid 8/10.</div>\n",

A simple entertaining film if you're able to see past some of its obvious faults. The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.<br/><br/>Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.</div>\n",

       "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Thought Bland Adam was another misfire for the DCEU Universe. Basically a poor combination of Justice League, Eternals and Shazam! This is a movie I probably won't remember at all in the near future. Too much slo-mo and lack of fun. Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.<br/><br/>Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time. Dwayne Johnson has little charisma in this film and I simply didn't care what happened. This was overall kinda bad honestly.<br/><br/>3.5/10.</div>\n",

       "[[\"Black Adam is not without its flaws, but i still enjoy the hell out of it, the problem that i have with Black Adam is that i never really buy all the Kahndaq people 100%, in the end i only still buy half of it, but i still fine with it, it's not like their characters are terrible, it just most of the time they are doing just a poor performance except the actress who played the mom and probably Ishmael for the most part, at least i still got some of the laughs from one of them, some of the slower scene was sometimes misplaced including some of the flashback, and some nit picky here and there, the rest of Black Adam is an exciting comic book film that fills with a very impressive battle that also fills with dazzling visual and cool style, Black Adam himself played incredibly well by Dwayne Johnson, he was just unstoppable in the most badass way, Justice Society has just become one of my favorite superhero team specifically in movies, they are fun and they are great, Hawkman, Doctor Fate, Cyclone, and Atom Smasher all of them are a hit for me, i love every single one of them, though i do wish they have something more with Doctor Fate because i think Pierce Brosnan was just unbelievably good playing the characters, again at least we do still have that one moment, i would love to see Justice Society again in movie maybe even their own movie, i would also love to have a specifically Doctor Fate standalone or a prequel film, and last but not least, the main villain, i think the main villain is doing as fine as most of the hero in the movie, so overall Black Adam is a quite a fun ride, 2 hours did feel quite goes by, an exciting back and forth battle that fills with dazzling visual effect and style, great score, great sound, great performances for most of the cast, being the first original DCEU movie that release in theaters only since WW84, Black Adam is not perfect but it's still great, it's still fun, it's still fascinating, it's still exciting, and i enjoy the hell out of it.\",\n",
       "  'Black Adam is the perfect example of how inaccurate critics can be. By judging this movie by classic movies standards they end up pointing the obvious : wow it\\'s just cgi fights after cgi fights.What they don\\'t get is that Black Adam is a very enjoyable piece of entertainment replicating perfectly the gleeful experience of reading a comic book.This is the first superhero movie to emulate the extreme craziness of Michael Bay golden era. It\\'s all there: the helicopter crash, the endless slow mo, the Dutch angles, the two minutes of dialogues sandwiched between fifteen minutes of explosions and of course the louder-the bass-the-better soundtrack.And guess what? It works. Mostly.Yes the Justice Society is a bunch of cosplayers with zero back story or character development but with dodgy priorities and powers that we\\'ve seen already in many superheroes before. But the effects are bold and spectacular, the colors wild, the camera moves astonishing. Add to it Zack Snyder\\'s sepia tones, men in sandal obsession and anime like fights scenes (they reminded me of the best of Man Of Steel) and you have a very convincing \"comic book to screen\" adaptation.Of course with this many new characters without a very precise goal most of the time, you end up with logistic issues where they just disappear offscreen during a fight for a little while and show up neatly when they have to. But that\\'s because they all know they have to leave the room for the Rock whose statuesque figure was born for destroying fictional cities and throwing villain soldiers in the sky. Yeah that\\'s the one thing Michael Bay wouldn\\'t approve, you don\\'t disrespect the military like that!',\n",
       "  \"What a movie! The special effects are really immersive and really give an immersion to the city Kahndag. We learn more about his story and the way that the whole habitants become slave. Black Adam have a story that become more and more interesting and give some surprises, revelations and a new orientation for the future of Black Adam ( with superman at the end). All the super heroes were awesome to watch by their suit, their powers, their goals and the confrontation between the justice society of America and Black Adam give some interesting theme to talk about: is Black Adam really a vilain? What is a hero? What is his duty? A hero can call himself a hero if he can free their people from slavery even he did bad actions? Where is really the line between vilain and superhero? I mean there were interesting things to talk about and the plot get more and more interesting even if its begin in a classic way: the curse of the wizards to make Black Adam a prisonner and his story have a lot of subtilities when other point of view will discuss about the Black Adam Story and his real intentions (his anger cant be under control and can become a treat but the real vilain who is Ishmael because its a descendant of the ancient king of Khandag and it will tell an other point of view about Black Adam because he saw him cried about a boy who get killed and its in fact was his boy who give him the power. So i mean there was some interesting revelations and surprises and bring more nuances to that Black Adam's character. And all the fights in the movie were pretty great and pretty epic. The justice society and their heroes were great ( special mention to Atom, DR Fate, Hawkman) and with them they will discuss more about what is an hero and how to act like one and not just said an hero its this and that make you an hero: it have more subtility and i really appreciated even if i didnt go watch Black Adam mainly for his story but i appreciate it anyway. It have also some drama moments with DR Fate and Hawkman but Dr Fate will save the world at the cost of his life and give an interesting view that DR Fate's character and give another interest to watch the movie because it really have some surprises and revelations during the whole movie and have no break for us to take during 2 hours and thats a good thing. Im glad that the movie have some subtilities and make him more interesting and thats not a battle about to see who is stronger but just to test the value and their intentions and their motivations and really make them stand out each of them and give interesting duels in spirit and physical (Hawkman and Black Adam).And at the end, maybe a collaboration with Black Adam and Superman? Or a duel? Very good DC Movie and bring a new world in an existed one (Shazam) but give an identity and a story to an hero/vilain character that will make him interesting to watch in next movies.\",\n",
       "  'In the superhero movie genre I would rank this somewhere in the middle, which of course also means that this is a fantastic movie from a DC-perspective. DC have really been digging below the bottom of the barrel, and with only one exception every other single movie have been horrible.This is not horrible. Actually this is kinda entertaining, it is fun, and the movie flies by in a very brisk pace. The more or less constant fighting is pretty great, and they even manage to get a few one-liners in there. Even the CGi is good (mostly), which can only mean that DC finally got rid of their awful special effects team.But this is not really great either. This is a very single-minded kind of movie. Evil bla bla bla curse lots of slow-mo accompanied by superhero bombastic music and lots of crashing buildings, lots of disposable henchmen. Sure there is a underlaying theme of \"who is really a hero?\" and a few tiny tidbits of story, but mainly this is like a huge wrestling match with pretty unpretentious smashing. Since everything move so quickly we also have no time to breath or get to know these characters. I wish there was 20min more with some background stories, but nah, smash more, blow up more stuff, woosh, blam, slam.If you have no intention of seeing anything but a big long slugfest with a lot of CGi and you do not care about story or character development, then you are likely going to love this. From that perspective, and from a DC perspective, this movie is pretty good, almost great. But if you weigh in actual movie value such as script, characters, and storytelling well... then not so much.I give this a 7/10 just because I was entertained and since I am happy to see a DC film that do not suck like a boring black hole. But to be honest that score is too generous. Worth the ticket price though; so I recommend!',\n",
       "  \"I had no knowledge about Black Adam prior to seeing the movie, haven't watched the latest trailers nor had any high expectations before going to the movie.But wow, I was oh boy taken by surprise by the movie!Okay, it's not the best super hero movie out there and doesn't have an overwhelmingly deep story. But it doesn't try to be that either.It was fun, enjoyable, fights where amazing, soundtrack was great, just a well-made hero movie where you can see superhumans dish out in fight!And considering the quality of the MCU we have received recently, I would definitely recommend this one to avid super hero fans!\",\n",
       "  'No, the hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the introduction of \"Black Adam\". This was a very mediocre film, and felt like a very colour by numbers superhero film, designed and tested to please as many audiences as possible. Meaning it plays it safe and doesn\\'t take any risks. But I enjoyed it, it\\'s a very entertaining watch with lots of huge setpieces! In fact, once it gets going it doesn\\'t stop... it\\'s a non-stop, action-packed thrill ride! It\\'s only problem - it\\'s so average; something we\\'ve seen a million times before. It almost left me feeling a bit of superhero fatigue, as everything just felt recycled. I kept waiting for it to do something fresh and new, and while there were a few good moments, overall the movie was incredibly predictable. I even had moments wishing the action would slow down so we could get another dialogue scene or something that would flesh out the characters more. The script just isn\\'t great, frankly. But it\\'s still a good time. I think of it like this; Black Adam is a bad movie held together by some AWESOME moments!So let\\'s get these negatives out of the way. The script is extremely weak and very predictable, heck the trailers even spoiled a \"twist\" near the middle of the film. It\\'s not hard to figure out what the movie is doing, especially for those of us who\\'ve seen a lot of these superhero movies over the years. It doesn\\'t try all that hard to keep eventual reveals hidden, as it\\'s more focused on giving its protagonist the flashiest, most murder-filled debut in the DCEU (even though I would look to \"The Suicide Squad\" for that). It really felt like the creative team saw Black Adam being an anti-hero as an excuse to let them have the character kill everyone. It felt so overplayed and obnoxious, like they were trying to say \"see look how brutal we can make this\" without actually earning the audience\\'s investment. The scenes where Black Adam just goes around dominating everyone just felt empty, like sure it was cool to see him be so powerful and instantly kill people, but it took all the tension out of the scenes. It felt like they were beating me over the head with \"look how powerful and ruthless he is\". The novelty of it wore off very quickly too, so thank god the film introduces the Justice Society pretty quick! They did make the smart choice of making this equal parts a Justice Society film as they did a Black Adam film, and I gotta say while I did find the character of Black Adam quite interesting, it was the Justice Society (mainly Hawkman and Doctor Fate) that I loved!It\\'s when the Justice Society comes in that the movie remembers how fun exciting superhero stories can be. I enjoyed their part in the story the most, and instantly loved the characters. Pierce Brosnan\\'s Doctor Fate was awesome, it was so cool to see Brosnan in a superhero role. He did feel a little reminiscent of a certain Marvel Doctor, but that\\'s okay because they both have some COOL scenes; Fate had some of the most memorable in the film! Hawkman was also pretty badass, I really hope to see these characters again! And I gotta say, I did love Dwayne Johnson as Black Adam. He suits the role very well and I\\'d love to see this iteration of the character return. I\\'m just not sure how I feel about him in this movie. It makes him look cool and all, and Johnson\\'s physique is perfect for the character, but he had almost no story. Like they introduced his backstory and everything, but once the movie got going it never stopped to examine his character; we never understood how he felt about anything, which made him just come across as an uncharming sociopath. This is especially unusual for Johnson, as we all know how undeniably charismatic he can be, and he just isn\\'t here. But damn he sure is magnetic and does command the screen with his hulking form and brooding looks. The only cast members I didn\\'t like, and this was more because of the way their characters were written, were Adrianna and her son. They really did not work for me and made some really dumb decisions throughout the movie, and had some very cringey scenes. But luckily that was only a minor part! There was some cool cameos too, surprisingly from James Gunn\\'s \"The Suicide Squad\" and of course a certain cast member from \"Shazam!\". I did love these little connections- it\\'s nice to see the DCEU try to be interconnected again! And the \"Shazam!\" stuff was awesome, it showed some things I wished we got to see in that movie! And how could I forget... There was one other cameo I did really love. It\\'s definitely the worst kept secret in Hollywood... but made for an awesome end credit scene and made this fan very happy!The filmmaking here is abysmal. Jaume Collet-Serra has never made a great movie, instead making B-level movies at the studio level... and this might just be proof he is not capable of directing films of this scale. He makes every moment feel mundane; from Black Adam going on a killing spree to the big fight between the JSA and Black Adam, these moments should feel engaging and cool, but instead just bored me, frankly. It feels like he is trying so hard to show spectacle, but he ultimately fails, making it all feel cheap and generic. I also couldn\\'t stand the cinematography. It seems like they shot the film to look like Zack Snyder\\'s \"300\", with bland colours and lots and lots of annoying slo-mo. At least the CGI was good! There were some moments that had their flaws, but overall this movie has some awesome CGI (and a seemingly obligatory CGI filled 3rd act). Don\\'t even get me started on the truly awful sound mix, it just felt like sound was being blared in my face for 2 hours and I couldn\\'t discern what I was hearing. It just sounded messy. The score isn\\'t memorable, instead it just sounds like a jumble of notes and digital instrumentation, it has no emotional core to the music and it is just noise. Even the dialogue is not mixed well, but that\\'s okay because the dialogue is horrendous anyways.So why, after all that complaining, did I ultimately enjoy myself while watching? Well, because it has enough cool moments that I came out satisfied. I have never seen a movie so bad that I still enjoyed this much. It\\'s remarkable how well a few moments and ideas can make for an enjoyable viewing experience. The disappointing part of this is, if only they put the good moments together in better ways this could have been an awesome film, but instead it misses so many opportunities. There was one moment that really stands out to me because it made me want to cheer however, and that was the awesome reference to \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\", I feel like many superhero fans will miss that reference, but for me as a cinephile that scene quickly became my favourite in the film! The film felt like it was made in the 90s, before the MCU, before X-Men, before superhero flicks became popular back when they were still trying to figure them out, it was just all over the place. And it also happened to be pretty derivative of other films- \"Avatar\", \"Black Panther\" and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\" especially. But despite all my issues I have with this film - and I have many - it somehow still managed to entertain me and leave me satisfied by the time it was over (possibly because of the awesome end-credit scene). It was kind of like \"Venom\"... just some mindless superhero fun! I wish it was a better movie because it did have some awesome elements, but as a film it ultimately fails. I would like to see more of Dwayne Johnson\\'s \"Black Adam\", especially in a potential \"Black Adam v. Superman\" movie he keeps talking about! With some improvements, it could be a much better movie than this, while still being entertaining!',\n",
       "  \"I knew nothing of Black Adam going in so it was pretty cool to discover who he is and what he's about. This is a fast-paced and fun movie with some good action scenes. The musical score is great, and of course it's composed by beast Lorne Balfe who has become a star. I like the cast and was pretty happy with the 300-feel it gave me a few times.This movie is also flawed. Not everything works. Much of the comedy doesn't hit. There is a bunch of basic dialogue. It's not a good sign when I can predict the next line multiple times.There seems to be a LOT stolen from Marvel. I'm not a comic book guy and have no stakes in the Marvel vs DC debate. I don't know which of these characters were created first. But the four side-heroes are all analogous to Marvel characters we've already seen in movies for years. We have an Ant-man, a Doctor Strange, a Falcon and a Storm (sort of). I'll give them props for the last two possibly being cooler than their Marvel counterparts. But it wasn't just the characters, there were at least four moments that reminded me of something from a Marvel movie.I tried not to let that factor into my feelings for the movie. And even with this slightly positive DC chapter, I continue to hope that DC can do better. I know they can. The Dark Knight trilogy is still GOAT and I love the first three movies after that. I really hope they can do better in the future. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 10/20/2022)\",\n",
       "  '\"Black Adam\" is the 11th film in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a spin-off from 2019\\'s \"Shazam!\". Starring Dwayne Johnson in the title role, it delivers explosive action scenes with great special effects that should satisfy fans of the superhero genre.Five thousand years after being bestowed with the power of ancient gods and then sealed away, Teth-Adam (Dwayne Johnson) is released from his prison in the modern day city of Kahndaq. Shocked at how much the world has changed, Adam goes on a rampage, brutally killing many hostile soldiers and other adversaries in the process. In an attempt to quell Adam\\'s rage, the Justice Society of America (JSA), consisting of Doctor Fate (Pierce Brosnan), Cyclone (Quintessa Swindell), and Atom Smasher (Noah Centineo) set off for Kahndaq to halt this senseless destruction before it is too late.Since his comic book debut back in 1945, Black Adam (a.k.a. Teth-Adam or Theo Adam) has been depicted as both a hero and a villain at various points. In recent years, however, he has been reworked as an anti-hero, retaining his violent streak while also wishing to help out the less fortunate wherever possible. The character\\'s sudden acquisition of superpowers lends itself to the idea that owning such inhuman strength also runs the risk of misuse and corruption along with it. This concept certainly pushes the typical \"with great power comes great responsibility\" formula to the limits and in this 2022 film about the titular character, we now get to see that notion play out for us in live-action.I have to admit it\\'s quite refreshing to see a superhero film where its main character is neither good nor bad but rather a neutral party in all of this. So often in these types of stories we watch as our protagonist simply acquires his or her powers and immediately goes off to do heroic or villainous deeds without a second thought. Here, we get to see Black Adam come to terms with what powerful abilities he has unwillingly been given, undecided as to what allegiance he falls under. In one scene, we see Adam mercilessly slaughter armed soldiers one by one, literally reducing some of them to ashes but shortly afterwards he saves the lives of a young boy and his mother caught in the crossfire. The ambiguity as to whom Adam wants to protect versus whom he wants to kill becomes a common theme throughout the movie, which does a nice job of making you wonder what battles he\\'s going to pick and choose.To compliment these internalised conflicts, we also have some highly entertaining action scenes to go along with them. In addition to the aforementioned fights against soldiers, there\\'s extensive gunfire and explosive weaponry frequently used against Adam during battle, of which proves futile in the end. These moments helped move the film along at a brisk pace, leaving little room for anything boring to transpire. Of course, as is usually the case in most superhero films, there is so much collateral damage left in the wake of scenes like these. As fun to watch as these parts were, I couldn\\'t help but feel a little sorry for the poor people of Kahndaq as their city is subject to so much destruction throughout the chaos. It\\'s just as well Kahndaq is a fictional place because I hate to imagine how costly it would be in real life to rebuild everything that was destroyed in the melee. This may seem like a trivial nitpick, but considering how ancient the city is supposed to be, it feels kind of painful to see so many things of historical value smashed to pieces for the sake of an action setpiece.As the film is a spin-off from \"Shazam!\", one of the more amusing entries in the DC Extended Universe, there\\'s also some light-hearted comic relief to ease the tension of certain serious scenes. While the jokes were rather hit-and-miss and didn\\'t always land, the ones that did provided some much needed humorous moments, showing yet again that DC films are capable of being funny whenever they want to be. In particular, I liked the scenes where Adam tries to comprehend modern day lexicon when compared to how things were over five thousand years ago. I suppose it is similar to how Thor tried to blend in with the humans in the MCU, only this time with the more sinister undercurrent of Adam turning rogue at any time.It seems long overdue that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson play a superhero/supervillain in a comic book movie and now we finally get to see him do just that. Given his muscular physique, a character like Black Adam suits Johnson perfectly. It\\'s great fun to see Johnson put his strength as a former wrestler to good use as he throws his enemies across ridiculous distances, not once caring where they might land. At the beginning, I half expected him to be constantly spouting lame one-liners and pulling weird reaction faces at strange scenarios, but for the most part Johnson plays the role very seriously. You certainly gain a solid understanding of why he doesn\\'t consider himself neither good nor bad, which made his character a more compelling anti-hero. That\\'s not to say he\\'s always downbeat, because he definitely has his fair share of comical moments from time to time.The rest of the supporting cast were decent, with Quintessa Swindell and Noah Centineo fitting in reasonably well as Cyclone and Atom Smasher, respectively, but only Pierce Brosnan as Doctor Fate left any lasting impression on me. His character appears to be the Doctor Strange of the DCEU (though Fate\\'s comic debut predates Strange\\'s creation by 23 years), summoning spells and incantations that allow him to stand head-to-head with Black Adam during his violent rampages. Unlike Strange, however, Fate doesn\\'t have an inflated ego and is relatively level-headed and calm, much like a certain famous spy Brosnan has played in the past. To be fair though, Dwayne Johnson is a hard act to outshine due to his natural charisma so if there\\'s any actor in this film who comes close, it would be the one who used to play James Bond.Taking into consideration the current state of the DCEU, an entry like \"Black Adam\" doesn\\'t really offer anything better or worse than what we\\'ve already experienced many times before. It works simply as an entertaining, action-packed, effects-driven superhero film that will hopefully keep fans happy for two whole hours. I am curious to see how Black Adam will be integrated among the other DC heroes, especially with the ones from \"Shazam!\", but for now he works just fine as a standalone character. However, judging by the mid-credits scene, things do look promising.I rate it 7.5/10.',\n",
       "  \"Black Adam is the latest film in the DCEU, and boy, it packs a punch. Explosions, flying superheroes, magic, lightning and beautiful armour follows the Justice Society, and of course Black Adam.The film centers around a god-like ancient human being who was gifted his powers in a time of darkness and enslavement. After being defeated and unseen for over a 5000 years, he returns, his goal being unknown. With the powers he has a group of superheroes, the Justice Society, deems him to be a threat, and performs an attempt to lock him up, unknown of the real danger.It is better than people say. Although at first glance it seems to be a film simply made for the action and explosions, it does have a story, strong dialogues and character development. The visual effects are astonishing in every single way, and people who have watched Avengers: Endgame will love the visuals in this film.My personal rating? A 10/10. My rating based on realism, plot and other factors? An 8 or a 9/10. If I'm going to be honest, the worst thing about this film was some unrealism like characters being able to survive a lot more than possible, and some being quite dumb in terms of their actions.As for my conclusion: Black Adam is a great, visually wonderful film with lots of action violence and lovable characters. Watch it in the cinema for a lifetime experience.\",\n",
       "  \"Just an average superhero movie with a 2005 vibe which was odd but let me tell you . Dr.fate is so fricken cool , best choice d.c had . They should've called it black rock because all you see is Dwayne roided up acting like Dwayne . Action is non stop pretty much so it doesn't fail on that part . Story is kinda meh , typical dc writing . Atom , well there's going to be a lot of comparisons to Deadpool per say . It's a fun popcorn movie check it out, expecially for the casuals who don't know much about black Adam . I think the comic nerds might not like a lot of it but that's okay . This movie is not for everyone but if you're looking for a good time , this movie definitely hits that spot.\",\n",

Aldis Hodge and Pierce Brosnan are phenomenal and the justice society of America makes it more fun and interesting(except cyclone). Hawkman,Black Adam are the badass in this film. Dwayne Johnson is really born to play this character and watch out for the mid credit scene!.This is the movie for a great momentum for the future of DC universe.At the negative side, villain is not intimidating and storyline is repetitive and there some cheesy scenes but overall this movie is a blast.So excited for the future of dceu. 7.5/10.',\n",
       "  \"For a while here there's a sense that DC, on one of its few and far between occasions, has managed to deliver a feature film product worthy of its source material (and extensive budgets) with director Jaume Collet-Serra managing to start Black Adam in a fun and exciting fashion that seems to suggest audience goers were going to be treated to something a little unexpected, something just slightly amended from the usual playbook of initial superhero adventures but then all hope and excitement is extinguished by a teenage boy and his ever-present skateboard.More on that later.A much-hyped production that its leading man has been championing for the better part of the last few years, Black Adam presents DC with one of its greatest chances yet to bring one of its more complicated creations to screen and while his natural charisma (that you either love or hate) is mainly squashed in a role that brings to mind Arnie from Terminator 2, Dwayne Johnson fits the bill to be our anti-hero Teth Adam but despite some impressively staged early action scenes and a narrative that doesn't always play to the rules set out for large blockbuster origin stories such as this, Black Adam is unable to keep the foot on the gas as some questionable narrative decisions and character inclusions halt much of the films progress in being a silly but fun popcorn munching ride.There are times here when you forget you're watching a Black Adam film with Bodhi Sabongui and Sarah Shahi's Kahndaq natives Adrianna and Amon Tomaz joining Adam's journey as he awakens from a 5000 year slumber to all of a sudden be battling unknown forces and Aldis Hodge's Hawkman led Justice Society, with these two characters playing large roles in proceedings to an extent they become a genuine annoyance and by the time Amon is rallying local citizens in one of the most cringe-worthy battle cries committed to celluloid before leading a charge on his beloved skateboard you know that Black Adam has failed to hit the mark.These glaringly non-important characters and plot diversions do in some ways mask other problems that become more apparent as Black Adam's runtime wears on with Collet-Serra's insistence on including either a blasting musical score or Spotify 101 pump up songs in all of his abundant slow-mo action scenes or a collection of underdeveloped characters that includes the films main villain and Justice Society members Atom Smasher and Cyclone other reasons why the film fails to go on with its various moments of promise, with one almost wishing we were allowed more time to get to know Adam or even Pierce Brosnan's Dr. Fate/Kent Nelson, who steals many of the films best scenes with one hoping the veteran screen actor gets a chance to shine in a solo outing in the near future.To be fair to all involved, Black Adam is far from the worst DC movie to come our way but in regards to promise and potential verses the final outcome, this loud, colourful and soulless outing is equivalent to the likes of Man of Steel and Suicide Squad as features that seemed to be set to shine only for poor decisions and weak directive decisions hampering any chance they had of shining on the big stage.Final Say -Not without its moments, Black Adam is hampered by an increasingly painful plot-line and even worse supporting characters that take away from the films early signs that it is looking to do something a little different than the usual origin story run-through.2 1/2 skateboards out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)\",\n",
       "  \"I think the movie was fine. Actually, it was pretty messy in a lot of ways. The villain was quite lacking in depth, and the pacing was too fast, making some scenes quite chaotic. The characters' development was okay for Black Adam and the JSA, but the boy that has a pretty large amount of screentime couldn't make me care about him, and I couldn't even remember his name. But just for the sound and visual aspects, Black Adam was completely worth enjoying; it was a visual and aural feast. The CGI battles were pretty insane, but also overwhelming sometimes. Overall, a 7 for me. Although Superman's appearance was fantastic, I think killing off Kent Nelson was a bad choice because he was definitely the highlight of the JSA team.\",\n",
       "  \"I was shocked by how much I disliked Black Adam. I didn't really have any expectations for this movie, as the only real knowledge I have about the character comes from the Injustice video game series. However, Black Adam takes all the elements of bad superhero flicks and crams them into one loud & messy movie. While it does have some exciting action sequences, it also had too many characters, not enough backstory, heavy-handed messages, bad acting, forced humor, sloppy editing, awful dubbing, and an overreliance on CGI. I spent the first half of the movie confused, and the second half annoyed.\",\n",
       "  \"Director Juame Collet-Serra's extensive experience helming thriller films is quite evident here; the action-while not particularly distinctive-is more than sufficiently hard-hitting, gleefully destructive, and thrilling to keep the film from ever becoming dull.That's quite the achievement, because on paper Black Adam is a largely dull exercise. It's entirely derivative of other, better superhero films, and is without an ounce of any sense of originality in what it delivers to this corpse of a genre.The film has a villain who is never really introduced until the final act and is laughably cartoonish. He's a punching bag for the characters to have something to fight at the end of the movie.The ordinary mortal characters are just as lifeless. Most of the people in this movie aren't actual living, breathing human beings, but plot devices.That being said, The Rock's titular character of Black Adam is actually handled surprisingly well. His background of tragedy is thoroughly explored (even though it's through clunky narration exposition dumps), and does undergo tangible internal change over the course of the story.Adam's change in self-image has moderately thought-provoking implications as he comes to realise that his past failures don't determine currency worthiness.This is one of only two bright spots in the writing, along with watching Adam and Hawkman clash in their worldviews/opinions of justice.I really do wish that these bright spots made up more of the movie. Because the entire plot is constructed solely of story beats and objects and antagonists who have not only been seen before, but have been seen before so often-and exactly in this way-that they've been beaten more than any deceased horse.Consequently, it's a sometimes charming, largely competent exercise in rote rehash.\",\n",
       "  \"Was anybody really excited about Black Adam? Maybe there are people who were, but as for myself and the people I know, Black Adam was just yet another superhero movie in an unending line of superhero movies; all the same with nothing new or fresh to offer. But still, as is custom, I had to go check this movie out because Sri Lanka's roster of theater releases aren't that great, so I'll take whatever comes.Black Adam ended up being sometimes funny, a little more than sometimes cringe, and extremely mid. It's a movie with the most generic stakes ever, and with nothing new to add to a genre that has been the same for the past few years. The only aspect I personally enjoyed in the movie was Pierce Brosnan, and sometimes The Rock, but everything else fell flat. Especially whatever the writers tried to do with the Amon character. Things couldn't have been more generic than that.Overall, is it a bad movie? Far from it. Is it good? NO. Should you watch it? Well, you wouldn't be missing anything if you didn't.\",\n",
       "  \"Black Adam is a superhero movie's superhero movie: and it seems like critics and audiences (even though they're both one and the same most of the time) are becoming evermore divided on what one group thinks about the productions in question. Yes the film's cliched, yes the characters don't exactly have depth to them through most of the movie, yes the CGI evokes Star-Wars-Prequel-Trilogy-Ragdoll-Physics or 2000s-Ragdoll-Physics, but Dwayne Johnson is such an entertainingly stoic action-man that it's like he's playing an unironic parody of action movies that it just goes with the flow of its own self-aware sense of Hollywood-isms.Black Adam is an origin story, a team-up movie, a villain showcase, and somewhat confused in its fan-service like the LITERAL POSTERS of the Wonder Woman movie, Batman-comic-accurate-artwork, Superman merchandise, Injustice toys (from the video games), and the Suicide-Squad-style intro to our supporting characters makes you wonder... is DC Films self-aware of its success AND shortcomings in the past, and is just throwing everything into a blender with these shared-universe movies? If so: interesting choice. It doesn't work for 'serious cinema' necessarily, but it's a nice approach that can certainly be refined. Just... have the fourth-wall-breaking-fan-service make sense in the story; please?Anywho: Black Adam has FINALLY been released after years of false-starts, Tweets, and studio-reshuffling to make even seasoned studio executives perplexed, and 2022 has Black Adam... breaking away from Shazam entirely. The two were originally gonna be in the Shazam! Movie. Makes you wonder if it should've stayed that way? At least they're finally in cinema: and now they can breathe in sequels I suppose.This movie may not be what some of the fans are expecting, but the fan-service on display does work (when it makes sense) and the action can be a sight to behold, and the leading man himself knows how to rock the spandex look absolutely. The screenplay is a confused mess scared of the antihero theme making 'The Rock' look like a villain; so they sprinkle conflicted protagonist and boom, Black Adam's now a superhero. 3/5 stars.For all that doesn't work in the film, the stuff that does keeps it from becoming downright tedious thankfully. When it's action-heavy it's action-heavy. With the fan service it's going all the way when it can. Just don't expect the story to break your minds or something. It's fairly straightforward stuff: and maybe that's what is bothering the critics.\",\n",

       "  'Since around late 2019, I have boycotted all superhero movies all that noise all that endless repetitive fighting that achieves little. However, as the Rock was the star of this one I thought I would try it out. Dwayne Johnson is one of those none actors like Arnie before him who seem to play themselves in every movie but yet it works. So what would the Rock add to Black Adam?Sadly not much, I am afraid I found this bad boy anti-hero dull and uninteresting and I was yawning for the end long before the final round of action stuff which as we all know the good guys always win, but could they not do it in a neat 90 minutes but at least this one was over in 124 though it felt much more like 180. One more observation I thought much of the special effects looked distinctly average perhaps this is a budget, superhero.If it cost $100 million it must be Hollywood inflation. I love the movies at the movies, and so I will be back but not for Black Adam 2 but for the next hopefully decent Dwayne Johnson action movie.',\n",
       "  \"Black Adam (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theaters last night. This storyline follows an ancient being known as Black Adam awaken within some ancient ruins. There is a race to find a historical crown that contains demon powers that is tied to how Black Adam gained his powers. As Black Adam's chaos begins he gains the attention of the Justice Society that will try to contain Black Adam while also thwarted the evil doers trying to get the crown. The question becomes which side will Black Adam take, the side of the evil doers or join forces with the Justice Society?This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (The Rundown), Aldis Hodge (Hidden Figures), Pierce Brosnan (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Mohammed Amer (Mo).It's impossible not to like a super hero movie with this many kill scenes. The Rock is absolutely awesome as Black Adam and his kill scenes are tremendous as are the running jokes tied to the killings. The comedic content overall is pretty solid. The special effects are tremendous and I enjoyed the inclusion of the Justice Society. Aldis Hodge delivers a strong performance as does Jalon Christian (A Journal for Jordan). The storyline is intricate and has some fun twists and turns and I enjoyed the conclusion. The post credits scenes is absolutely awesome too.Overall, this is a very well done addition to the super hero genre with enough unique elements to make it a must see. I would score this a strong 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.\",\n",
       "  \"Admittedly far from impressive, doesn't reinvent the wheel and writing wasn't so great, but I loved it still. My feelings kept changing before it's release, compared to the days I was excited for it, it didn't deliver as much, but if compared to the days I was scared it was gonna flop then Black Adam was actually way better than my expectations.The first scenes of the movie are great, sorta reminds me of mythical movies like clash of the titans or Hercules in which Dwayne Johnson featured in too. Not many movies like that being made, we went from gladiator movies to Greek god movies, somewhere in between had Egyptian mummies and now we're in a superhero phase. Still think superhero movies are awesome fun, even better when done right but I loved gods and mythical movies, and this puts them both together.It has an almost dark ambience to it but is still visually stunning with Cyclone and Atom smasher giving it a more prismatic feel. They also had a little side plot going that actually didn't get anywhere. Compared to other recent movies, I love that Black Adam's origin was handled in a God Butcher-esque way, it was dark enough to still keep it dark while still keeping a pg13 rating which I thought should've been higher before release.It also blends Black Adam's Bronze Age origins and magic with future tech. If you're more of a fan of the cinematic universes and don't really read the comics, the movie does it's best to give you a background introduction, but because of this the first part of the movie feels rushed because it's a lot to condense into the start. Don't really read the comics so I don't know if they did Black Adam's character justice for the comic fans.Adams intro in the movie so good, and his main adversary's was even better later on, actually devilish. I love how when DC super-powers someone, they really go for it and people really hated it with Henry Cavil's Superman. I love the idea of them potentially getting into a brawl in the future.Action is superb once it starts, delivers on expectations although the movie almost leans a lot on it's action. I also recommend avoiding spoilers and trailers as I did. Loved how Black Adam's sternness is written to some comedic effect at times, I often say Hollywood shouldn't try making every new superhero movie into a joke show and they kept it in a low here.Dwayne Johnson was great and did his character justice, so did Pierce Brosnan as Dr fate, I think Noah Centineo and Quintessa Swindell suffered from being underwritten side characters due to so much plot and other characters the movie had to fit in, so they didn't get as much time to shine. If there was an award for most cameos in the same movie... I also feel like black Adam was written perfectly but at the end started making mannerisms that broke from his character, like the smirking and smiles.The actual problems I had with the movie were once the premise is revealed the story progresses generically, so you can pretty much figure out where the story is going. It's pretty formulaic and the story narration wasn't something to behold. For that reason, as much as I still love it, it's not as good as it could've been, it does deliver on shifting the power dynamics in the dceu though. And with all the great action and cast coupled with decent story, it's still a fun watch. Secondly, something I rarely say, it could've been better if it was longer to let the story develop and add depth; because it has the makings of a great movie and really finds it's footing in the third act but then blitzes quickly through it to the end.And it promises a lot for the future, I hope future DC movies are more coherent like what MCU does by making their movies relate, not just having heroes cameoing in other heroes movies then bunching them all together. This could be a great start to a phase in the DC universe, could argue it started with Shazam but you get it.It's imperfect and has wiggle room for improvement but I love it and would recommend seeing it on the big screen. Deadpool has been my favorite antihero for a long time and is a whole different character but I think black Adam's taking that spot now. I loved the movie for Black Adam's character himself.\",\n",

Adding some ethnic flavor to his accent would've paid off mightily.Carrying echoes of Snyder but with the treatments and levity of the Wonder Woman and Aquaman entries to the DCEU, Black Adam hits the right notes and solidifies that the DCEU is alive and well.Unless you've been living under a rock, make sure to stick around for the post-credit scene.Solid 8/10.\",\n",

The action really felt like it was trying to be Zack Snyder lite, which partially works because it only tries to be lite in using that style even though the movie itself is action-packed. The characters are very forgettable although the performances of Pierce Brosnan, Aldis Hodge and the rest of the Justice Society members gives some life to it. The music was very underwhelming for me especially because it tries to elevate scenes by becoming loud and noticeable without making any impact.Black Adam is supposed to be an antihero but with a star like The Rock, he is only a reluctant hero who doesn't mind killing. Overall just a watchable film if you're a fan of the superhero genre.\",\n",

Pierce Brosnan was probably the highlight as he gives the film a little bit of a spark to the cast of characters.Otherwise very dull characters which you care little about, wonky special effects in places and humour which doesn't work most of the time.

       " ['\"Ticket to Paradise\" is the clear example that the trailer is better than the movie itself. The script does not bring anything new to romantic comedies, it rushes to take the already known formula and fill the plot with the typical clichés. Julia Roberts and George Clooney offer simple performances without much charm, the secondary characters are more endearing as is the case with Wren Butler played by Billie Lourd. The filming locations are extraordinary and the cinematography makes them look even more beautiful. Returning to the script, it fails to catch on and as entertainment it doesn\\'t go that far either. One of the worst moments is the terrible CGI with which a dolphin that appears on the screen for a few seconds was created. Movie to see once and not repeat.',\n",
       "  \"This is a loose remake of a French comedy with Dany Boon. That one was much funnier, with a better script. This one is lazy and treats viewers like morons, because it assumes that nice locations like Bali and two likeable, easy on the eye movie stars like Clooney and Roberts will guarantee success, no matter how bad and lazy the script is. It really looks like another comedy made quickly for Netflix. I don't recommend spending money on this, better wait for the streaming or TV... unless you are depressed, unhappy, down on your luck in your private life and quickly need some positive, optimistic and light entertainment. 3/10 for normal viewers, 8/10 if you're depressed and sad.\",\n",
       "  \"Ticket to Paradise follows a very familiar formula that has very few surprises in its narrative but that works as a nice reminder as to why this formula works so well when done right, especially in the hands of two perfectly matched screen legends.George Clooney and Julia Roberts are both great, having worked together many times before their chemistry and comedic timing is instant and extremely strong. Kaitlyn Dever is really good with a warmth makes her sudden relationship feel genuine.Ol Parker's direction is also really good, the location constantly looks gorgeous and it maintains a solid pace throughout. The music by Lorne Balfe works perfectly for the film's tone, so grand and swoon worthy.\",\n",

Now we have to see a bunch of other (below average) actors who only are present as \"fillers\" and who kinda irritated me by their bland acting performances.More bad: this movie wasnt funny. All the jokes fell flat. Honestly. This is suppose to be a romantic comedy, but I didnt laugh once. Not once. Bummer.The good: although it is lacking in good jokes, it has got TONS of sentimental, romantic scenes. It surely aint great drama (nowhere near), but it has got several tranquil, romantic scenes in which the right kinda sentimental loveydovey buttons get pushed, so all the fans of this romantic stuff will leave the cinema satisfied.All in all, I must say though that this is a missed opportunity to make a great romantic movie with these 2 stellar movie stars. They could have written a better script, with less stupid jokes and more true to life drama. Now it has become a Hallmark kind of movie, with lots of cheap sentiment that is a bit too much sugarcoated, (for me personally...)',\n",

       "  '\"Ticket to Paradise\" is a new English-language movie and a co-production between the UK and USA, even if the movie is for the most part set in Bali and was shot in Australia. So a bright mix of countries we have here that are attached to this project. It is a movie that runs for approximately 100 minutes, slightly under without and slightly over with credits apparently. The writer and director is British filmmaker Ol Parker, who is in his early 50s now, but looks a bit younger. He has worked with a few big name actors and especially actresses over the last ten years which may also explain why he got two really famous actors to play the protagonists in this new film we have here. This is of course a 2022 release. Maybe the most known work for Parker was the sequel to Mamma Mia! And this is also a key reason why I got curious about him and his newest film we have here. I did not really like the original Mamma Mia! Film, but the sequel I genuinely enjoyed. So I am surely more than just a bit shocked here with how little \"Ticket to Paradise\" worked for me. Perhaps it had to do with his co-writer Daniel Pipski. I am obviously not sure how much each of them contributed, but Pipski has mostly worked on some admittedly not bad television stuff in the last 15 years. What catches my attention more is the contribution to Milk, even if it was just in a smaller position. But back to this film here: The two leads are of course Oscar winners George Clooney and Julia Roberts. They have been together in many films, even if the ones you think of first for Roberts are maybe those that she had with other Hollywood heart throbs Richard Gere and Hugh Grant. But Clooney and Roberts seem to be fond of each other if you see them play co-leads this often and the last time is also not that long ago. I am not too big on Roberts, but I like Clooney, so I was especially disappointed how this turned out for him. Other family dramas with humorous inclusions that Clooney showed up in like Up in the Air or The Descendants I adored. But here it is all nothingness or feels pretentious, so the outcome gave off a very shallow vibe for me. I will elaborate on that in detail a little later.As I just mentioned The Descendants, which is also already over a decade ago (man how time flies), I found it a bit funny when Roberts\\' character here talks about how Clooney\\'s has never been to Hawaii, but maybe it was just me and maybe also not intentional. But I am sure Clooney thought about it too when shooting the scene. After all, he almost won an Oscar for his performance in that Alexander Payne movie. But yeah, Payne is not Parker, even if the first letters are the same, and the outcome here is disappointing. The rest of the cast are no big names at all. Kaitlyn Dever some will perhaps recognize, but she is the only one and she plays the older couple\\'s daughter here. This film at times almost felt like a Rosamunde Pilcher adaptation. How the daughter discovers the ring towards the end and that the parents took it was on the cringeworthy side. Quite the coincidence. But the worst of it all was really how Clooney\\'s and Roberts\\' characters were kinda getting together in the end. They were not too explicit about it, but them leaving the boat together to return to the island and also the weird kiss from before that made it relatively obvious. Of course, same applies to their daughter and how she talks about her mother\\'s new man. I honestly felt really bad for the guy. I mean he had a partner, the stunning (or \"stunning\") Julia Roberts, who is 25 years his senior perhaps. He is crazy about her, wants to marry her, always gives her the greatest gifts, surprises her all the time and yet he is totally the wrong person. The daughter called him less interesting than watching paint dry. He even gets bitten by a snake and there is saved by Roberts\\' character, so he is eternally grateful to her and he also gets bullied by that chubby airplane passenger. Okay, she was kinda funny honestly and also the conversation(s) with Clooney\\'s character.But back to what I actually wanted to say. Of course, Roberts\\' character eventually apparently gets together with the man who says that it is okay if she marries the other dude and that man she gets together with then is of course Clooney\\'s character. That was so ridiculous. I mean the film starts showing and telling us that they absolutely do not get along with each other at all and that they literally cannot stand each other one bit, but when coincidence strikes, they are united again and are forced to spend more time with each other and then grow closer again. I could not believe it the way the film started, also with the cringeworthy argument when they are up there in the stands. The very first scene of the film or two scenes I could say when we see and hear the two talk to friends I think it was about their shared past, the wedding proposal etc. Was also not good at all. This film started on a weak note. There weren\\'t many moments I liked linked to their relationship. One would maybe be when Clooney\\'s character says something about a motorbike rider that he only approves of him when Roberts\\' character falls off the bike or so. But that was almost the only moment when I smiled a bit. For one good inclusion there were five or six poor ones. Another weak almost recurring gag was when Clooney\\'s character made fun of the Frenchie. Or how the three of them meet there up on the airplane in the same situation. Again, unrealistic coincidence. The turbulence was poor pseudo drama. But what was way worse than the film\\'s misfiring on comedy was how it got the emotionally relevant moments all wrong. The talk about the special place felt gooey, so did the party and how the two protagonists wake up the next morning in the same bed. Or also in terms of words, not just in terms of actions. The idea of \"now is the time\" or what the exact words were was an okay one, but the execution was simply mediocre at best, also with the final shot when they are jumping into the water. What I found even worse though was the inclusion of \"wrong person, time and place\" and how all three must be correct and how Roberts\\' character quotes that towards the end when she breaks up with her young boyfriend.Her introduction was kinda messy altogether to me at the film\\'s start and here I am talking about how we see that she is a really successful businesswoman who easily pays for dinner at great restaurants and who effortlessly wins auctions where she pays several thousand dollars for exhibits while wearing really fashionable clothes. The one with Clooney talking to his buddy and doing sports was not any better. Also not sure why the daughter did not tell them during the phone conversation they would sit next to each other. I mean it is not an apocalypse or so. But that was chaotic already, so with watching stuff like this so early you cannot really get your hopes up for everything that follows afterwards. I mean the movie is not a failure, but there were weaknesses and these became especially visible when the movie took itself very seriously. Next example would be the \"not enough\" inclusion, first when Clooney\\'s character talks about that to his daughter\\'s boyfriend and next when the lead couple\\'s daughter quotes this basically and talks to her mother about the latter\\'s boyfriend. I must also say I found the daughter\\'s boyfriend pretty unlikable. He is depicted as the more interesting young man there, pretty smart and able to do physical work too and he understands immediately what happened with the ring, but even if you find him okay early on, when he goes on about how to treat nature on one occasion and all the miracles she provides it was also really pretentious I thought, even if in theory what he says is not wrong, but the film just felt so full of itself, so it was even worse to see that the younger female protagonist then answered something like how she never realized that she is so much out of balance. It just felt written and scripted on so many occasions. I do not even blame the actors. They tried their best with the delivery. I mean Dever is not Woodley, but still the core issue here is the screenplay and how it was all written, especially the dialogues. There aren\\'t many actors who could have made this work. Maybe none even.My negative recommendation should not surprise anybody. I know people are suckers for films based on works from Pilcher, Lindström and Fforde here in my country and while this film is maybe not as terrible as those, there are similarities and I am also not surprised by the rating above 6 on imdb, but I definitely agree with the more critical critics here and this film deserves only a 4 out of 10 I would say. I think this is all there is to say. Oh yeah, I also hated that we do not find anything about Clooney\\'s character, neither about his profession, nor life nor whatever. Except that he still has this beautiful spot, so they don\\'t build apartments there. Apparently, the character must also be relatively rich as a consequence. We also realize he is not willing to make a move on really young women as he probably could have when he talks to his daughter\\'s best friend when they have a drink together. Another kinda forgettable scene and no real significance. Finally, I mentioned the snake scene, so maybe animals are not depicted in the most friendly manner here because we have a dolphin attack Clooney\\'s character out of nowhere. Those animals can admittedly be fairly radical, but swimming with them would still be fascinating. Anyway, when they give medical treatment to him then immediately afterwards, it was also meant as another funny moment, but I did not think it was really and also I did not hear too many laughing from the maybe 25 people in my showing and I had a feeling that most were not really won over by the outcome here. It\\'s a movie you wanna skip, even if you like Clooney (and Roberts) like I do. Not recommended.',\n",

I understand that it was filmed in Australia during covid, but I would expect Australians involved in this movie to have stepped up their game and represented Bali as one should.There is almost nothing, not even the way the Balinese spoke Balinese, that I could say that this was Bali being represented well. Just when things started to look right or reaching a certain level of accuracy, the movie never fails to ruin it and make it a caricature of something that doesn't take much research to do. I'm not expecting much from a romcom, but everything that could easily be done to represent local Balinese anything, was executed incredibly poorly, lazy and disrespectful to anyone that is from Bali.They should have postponed this movie and filmed it 'post-covid'. Would have been more authentic and felt true to the Balinese culture/look.\",\n",
       "  \"George Clooney and Julia Roberts are two excellent actors and the Academy Awards they each won were well deserved. They are also two very suitable actors for romantic comedies, and if we accept the idea that good romantic comedies can be made with characters (and actors) in their 50s or even 60s, then casting them in the lead roles of a film of this kind may be a good idea. However, to make a quality romantic comedy something else is needed - a believable story that makes us resonate with the characters on the screen, possibly fall in love with them or suffer with them during the screening of the film. 'Ticket to Paradise' by director Ol Parker did not have the chance of such a scenario. By basing their film solely on the charm and magnetism of the two actors, the filmmakers have failed in their attempt to deliver quality entertainment. Clooney (at the peak of his charisma) and Roberts try their best, but it's not enough to save the film from the fate of a mediocre comedy.David (Clooney) and Georgia (Roberts) married 25 years ago and divorced 5 years later. Lily, their only daughter is finishing her law studies and a wonderful career awaits her starting in a prestigious law office. On the farewell college trip to Bali, the young woman meets a local seaweed farmer, falls in love with him, and decides to remain on the island paradise in the Indian Ocean. The two divorcees decide to join forces to convince their daughter to give up her marriage plans. The reasons are their own experience of a failed marriage but also the fear that the girl is destroying her life, at least according to Western or American patterns. The first 10-15 minutes offer the opportunity for funny exchanges of replicas, filmed with rhythm and using appropriately the technique of parallel frames. These are also the best comedic moments in the film, in my opinion. It is what follows that disappointed me.'Ticket to Paradise' reminded me of a tradition of American cinema in which the film fits very well. It's about dramas, sentimental comedies or musical films produced in the 30s whose stories took place in the world of the super-rich dressed in tuxedos, sumptuous dresses and fur coats. Spectators of those times, preoccupied with economic crises and - towards the end of the decade - with the danger of war, filled the theaters where charismatic heroes played by actors such as Clark Gable or James Stewart appeared on the big screens. With a few changes in scenery and dialogues, 'Ticket to Paradise' could have been made then. George Clooney is, by the way, the actor closest to the profile of the great American actors mentioned, and he is formidable in this film. But I think that his charm (and to a lesser extent that of Julia Roberts) are not enough to carry the whole movie. The relationship between the two is too predictable and the parallel love story between the two young people is completely missed. Kaitlyn Dever as the daughter is, I think, a terrible miscasting. At no point do we see her as an intelligent young woman making a sensible decision. The way in which the natural paradise of Bali is described is at the level of tourist clips commercials and the presentation of the local culture smella paternalistic Western folklorism. I understand that the intention of the filmmakers is here also an escapist cinema that disconnects its viewers from the problems of the day, but in the absence of authenticity and a somewhat believable story, the effect risks being missed. I'm afraid that only the joy of seeing George Clooney and Julia Roberts again and together is what will be left after watching this film.\",\n",

I mean, what is the rush to marry someone you have known for only 30 days? Maybe she had been binge-watching 30 day fiancé. I get that he's a hunk and it's a paradise island but after a couple of years of picking seaweed even that will get old.There was great chemistry between George and Julia and it kind of felt like we were cheated out of a proper smooch between them!

A story which has been told before, just in a new setting, but it's less about the story, more about the charm it gives. Comfort movie vibes. A little amusing I was the only one my age, audience was mostly middle aged women and a few slightly older than that men. Last that happened was when I saw The Good House which that made sense, but this is a movie for everyone, guess most were there for Black Adam which I admittedly saw first.Immediately catch the drift as it starts with the ex-husband and wife narrating totally different views on the same events. A lot of snarky, witty remarks throughout, not entirely quotable, nor cringe. Reminiscent of the early 2000's comedies, refreshing to see now; it even had bloopers in post credits top it off. The last recent attempt at making this sorta movie was I Want You Back which didn't really deliver.It was just funny, lighthearted and fun. Fun to see George Clooney and Julia robert's in a now rocky relationship, their disdain for each other's what made it work. It's actually not about the goofy stuff and more of the chemistry the characters had with each other which is why I think they should have given us more of Lily and Gede's relationship at the start because I was never really that invested yet their relationship was the crux of the movie that connected everyone. I should be more invested in it all more really. Does have a few emotive scenes.On paper, it has everything that could put in the same category as 50 first dates, how to lose a guy in 10 days, the proposal, even some of both Clooney and Robert's old movies; but it just doesn't have that oomph to make it special, despite the right ingredients. So what's missing?Those movies aren't the best on paper, but we love them and that's why they're comfort movies. While this is a good movie, it's not a movie I love, but it's in a genre where that's important. I can't explain it, it's a good movie that doesn't necessarily hold a place in my heart.

Maybe this scares me more than Smile did because that was more reminiscent of other horrors like the Ring.Over recent years I stopped watching horrors because new ones didn't scare me anymore and I thought oh maybe I'm just older; but now that I've found something one that's actually scared me to my core I don't know why I missed this. I think exorcist horrors are spine-chilling because demons are actually real to you especially if you grew up around church, unlike let's say vampire, psychological or zombie slasher.Didn't give it a 10/10 mainly because plot progresses pretty generically, even the twist felt lazy writing, but the fact that this is scary is really all you could ever ask a horror movie for. It could have been more graphic too, doesn't have a lot of images that stick with you and maybe the pg13 rating was limiting. A few unanswered questions i.e. Why Sister Ann was chosen. The story also lacked depth, not that it needed much though; I love that the runtime is relatively short and it uses the little it has effectively. Loved that the movie leaves an impression, not just to scare you while watching it but for you to think about it later before you sleep.Also, hopefully not a spoiler but that scene in the ambulance with the rosary was so bad ass, the demon knew he was bossing it with that pose waiting for the door to open. Favorite scene even though it's another were we whisked past the gore.I'm so happy this lived up to my expectations because it was the first time I was excited for a horror in years and it delivered so check it out. Reminded me why I used to enjoy horrors as a kid.\",\n",
       "  'After the huge surprise of the awesome horror movie Smile, I\\'m brought right back down to earth with Prey for the Devil. Right back to where the expectation is the vast majority of horror flicks will be terrible.There are two different routes to me giving a movie such a low score. One is that the movie is actively bad, laughable, filled with things to rip on. That\\'s not the case with Prey for the Devil. It takes the second route, the one where the movie has nothing of value. Nothing about it is good.This movie does a horrendous job at making you care. About anything. I couldn\\'t keep track of how many times I thought to myself, \"I DON\\'T CARE.\" Emotional moments, I don\\'t care. Major horror moments, I don\\'t care. Climax with stakes, I don\\'t care.If I were to rate the scariness, it\\'s a two out of ten. Zero tension, zero suspense. It made me jump maybe three times. I watched these supposedly scary scenes and felt absolutely nothing. I also think I might be done with exorcism horror flicks. A couple come out each year and they\\'re usually useless.In the end, Prey for the Devil is almost a complete waste of time. It might be good to reset expectations so I could be as pleasantly surprised the next time a movie like Smile comes along. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 10/27/2022)',\n",
       "  \"Honestly I'm a huge horror movie fan, from indies through to the big budget, I'll watch any but I just felt like I've seen this film a million times, done better and on budget dvd, there's nothing here that's new, fresh or interesting.We've seen the women overcoming oppression a thousand times, whilst it's obviously vital and any decent person agrees women deserve the same opportunities, I struggle with the logic that women can't do exorcisms as there's no physicality it's just waving a book, cross and some water.The acting is severely mediocre, the lead is someone I've known for years, at one point she looked extremely promising but she's definitely not a very good actor, very weak performance and poor delivery. Was disappointed massively in someone who's been around so long being so basic.Then there's the twist, it's a sad tired cliche at this point that made it so predictable, plus the thing was you just didn't care, you can't just rely on the child being young to get viewers support, lazy writing and basic execution.It's set up for a completely needless sequel that if it happens it'll be straight to dvd for half the price of one ticket.Horror is such a good genre, yet people can't imagine some fresh stories? I have so much more respect seeing people try new things and failing that people making these kinda movies over and over.\",\n",
       "  \"Much to my pleasant surprise, Prey for the Devil actually does have a sufficiently unique and compelling take on the possession sub-genre. Early on, the script introduces character background and thematic depth that causes the plot to largely be driven by an emotional core.In this film, unwillingness to forgive oneself becomes a poison that causes a person to lose themselves and gives demons power to take over their minds. Only complete and total self-forgiveness can eliminate the demonic threat in such cases.I loved this addition to the story, as it gave me something to root for beyond the rote plot machinations.I really just wish that the rest of the film was as compelling as this, because in terms of visual execution and story beats, this movie is as generic as they come.It's shockingly uninspired in its direction and in the set-up of its scares. Never once is it surprising or stunning. The actors give it their all but they really don't have anything to work with, as all the development was given to the themes and no room was left to tell us anything specific about the characters as they are in the present.The director used a lot of handheld camera work and close-ups, and this is sad as it doesn't utilise the insane potential of the gorgeous, often spacious location the film is set in.If a more artistically daring director had taken this script, they could have made it incredible. Instead, it's pretty middle-of-the-road.\",\n",
       "  \"Just finished watching a screener as I'm interviewing some the cast and thought this was a solid, well-directed and performed movie. When I watch horror films at home, the scares rarely get me but this one still managed to. Possession/exorcism films are nothing new, they've been around for decades but Prey For The Devil had some great surprises and twists to keep the story moving. Jacqueline Byers gives an incredibly vulnerable performance, with Posy Taylor also giving a great performance, sweet at times and disturbing at others.Christian Navarro was a very sympathetic leading man and it was cool to see him in a role like and moving on from teen roles. Colin Salmon and Virginia Madsen both gave solid performances as well. Wish they had a bit more to do in this one besides giving exposition or being opposing voices of reason, but happy to see them in another horror project.Overall I thought it was pretty scary, well executed and enjoyable.\",\n",
       "  \"The Roman Catholic Church combats a global rise in demonic possessions by reopening schools to train priests to perform exorcisms.Although nuns are forbidden to perform an Exorcism, a professor recognises Sister Ann's gifts and agrees to train her.Thrust onto the spiritual frontline, she soon finds herself in a battle for the soul of a young girl who's possessed by the same demon that tormented her own mother years earlier.......Prey for the Devil is this years Halloween horror film for the Tweenies who like to be scared, but not that much.This time, a demon is chasing a nun whom it found years earlier, which sounds just like the plot of Fallen, Insidious, and erm.....Jaws: The Revenge.And it wants to make itself clear to her that it's not giving up by providing endless jump scares, crosses turning upside down, and making a film for people with a hair fetish.And would you believe it? There is a major plot hole that you can see coming a mile off, and if you have seen the trailer, you have seen the film, as the beginning middle and the very end are shown.Praise the lord for Colin Salmon, who is brilliant in this and painfully underused, he should have been in every shot of the film, because when he's on the screen, it's a really good film.So if I may, I defy anyone in the final act not to think of Eddie Redmayne in a blonde wig whenever you see Ann on screen.Another wasted opportunity.....\",\n",
       "  \"I saw Prey for the Devil, starring Jacqueline Byers-Bad Samaritan, Roadies_tv; Colin Salmon-Nobody, Punisher:War Zone; Virginia Madsen-The Haunting in Connecticut, Candyman and introducing Posy Taylor-this is her first movie.This is a generic horror movie about exorcism-not much new here. Not bad, but not great either, just pretty standard. Jacqueline plays a sister/nun that is interested in becoming a fully licensed exorcist but the Catholic church frowns on women being in their men's only club-I guess they think only men know how to throw water on a demon and read passages out of the bible. Jacqueline tells Colin-a teacher/Father-about her past experiences with her own mother being possessed and he agrees to let her study with his class, after getting permission from the Cardinal, of course, who is played by Ben Cross in his last movie role-he died of cancer in 2020. Virginia is the church's psychiatrist that counsels Jacqueline about her childhood traumas and Posy plays a young girl that gets possessed. Jacqueline thinks it's the same demon in Posy that went after her mother years earlier.It's rated PG-13 for disturbing violent content, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.Like I said, it's pretty standard fare and I wouldn't buy it on DVD. It would be alright, as a rental if you like these types of movies.\",\n",
       "  \"Well here we are again. Halloween and just in time another possession film with every possible jump scare and cliche you've ever seen before. The formula is so worn out it's almost parodying itself unintentionally. Either way a new generation of horror fans will inevitably flock to it being the only other option than Halloween 37 this year. With plotting as hollow as ever and formulaic and cgi/jump scares that come Around nearly every corner, this film does nothing to separate itself. Attempts at ambitious twists fall short and end up being cheap. Actors are mtv caliber. Camerawork is rinse repeat. Just another possession film.\",\n",
       "  \"In 2021, this was called The Devil's Light and I was invited to be a part of a test audience for this movie. It was pretty good and had some decent scares. I decided to check this out again and was a little disappointed. Some scares, little bit of gore, and even an entire character was missing to make this a shorter, teen friendly pg13 movie.Wow, it stinks\\nI'm rating this 8 stars because the original version I saw was scary and had more thrills like the original Exorcist. This watered down version changed the name and entire storyline.Yes, there was a woman priest invited to an all male class of learning exorcism but the original focused more on the demon in her own life while she struggles to maintain her sanity. Still, I can't fault the producers for wanting a fast buck from teens looking to get scared. I just think had they kept the original, longer, and scarier version, they could have had a potential classic on their hands.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a predicable movie. The fact that the movie is about a nun entering the world of exorcisms which is a male Priest thing (I did not know that, but of course not surprised) is a unique pitch I'm sure got it greenlit by Hollywood, but as the story is laid out, nothing new is happening. It got to the point where I could guess pretty accurately what's going to happen next.That's not the real problem. The problem is the movie is not scary or disturbing or horrifying. In fact, the only horrifying part is that the movie was not scary or disturbing.My favorite part of the film is the Vatican itself. I do enjoy movies that show us the suppose combination of using the most Hi-Tech facilities to hold the history of the church.It's a good watch but I'm sure I'll forget it tomorrow.\",\n",
       "  'Director Daniel Stamm helmed one of my favorite horror films of all time: \"The Last Exorcism.\" No doubt a controversial opinion, I believe that \"The Last Exorcism\" remains a genuinely unique and expectation-subverting scary movie that breaks down the exorcism genre and builds it back up in a way that hasn\\'t been done since. So, you can imagine my surprise when it was revealed that Mr. Stamm was back in the director\\'s chair, once again at the helm of another supernatural flick. You can also imagine my surprise when, sitting down to watch this movie, I slowly but surely started to realize how garbage it is. I watch over 100 movies a year, and I can\\'t remember the last time I saw something so utterly irredeemable as \"Prey for the Devil.\" In fact, this movie is so generic, so boring, and so insulting to audience intelligence that I don\\'t even want to waste time writing about it, so I\\'m going to do my best to give the speediest, most efficient review ever, in hopes that you do literally anything else with your time except watch this movie. So let\\'s get started.Wooden acting. A lack of scares. Horribly written dialogue. An unoriginal and extremely predictable plot. \"Prey for the Devil\" has all of those things, and more, in mercifully short 90 minute run time that adds absolutely nothing new to the tired genre of exorcism films. Featuring a female exorcist, something that is forbidden in the Roman Catholic church, this movie wants its audiences to cheer for the movie\\'s \"daringness\" to break new ground; the problem is the main character, played by the beautiful\\nJacqueline Byers, is the most boring, stale character known to mankind. A combination of poor dialogue and mediocre direction throws any believability and sympathy for this character out the window - Ms. Byers\\' acting ability doesn\\'t help either, though I can\\'t blame her when she\\'s working with a script this terrible. And not just her, but every actor and character is as boring as a high school trigonometry class - everyone is repeating dialogue that you\\'ve already heard in a million other exorcism movies. And no one seems to be adding any personality to their character or spoken lines.The story itself does have an opportunity to be interesting, but quickly devolves into a generic, predictable mess - complete with an utter lack of scares or clever exorcism sequences. Sure, you\\'ll see bodies contorting and people climbing up walls, but it\\'s not scary, and it\\'s nothing new. The movie tries to shock its audience through climactic revelations that, in a better film, would genuinely shock - however, \"Prey for the Devil\" reveals said revelations with all of the impact of a cotton ball to the face due to actors and actresses reciting lines with the enthusiasm of a reanimated but still brain dead corpse. So, in other words, you\\'re getting a story you\\'ve already seen done a hundred million times before, with plot twists that won\\'t even register in your brain because of the inconsequential way that they are revealed.I was also shocked by how poorly directed and edited this movie was; scenes feel scatterbrained and chopped up, almost as if the movie originally started with one tone but was edited to fit another. What\\'s left is a very uneven and rapidly paced movie that, while quick on its feet, is simultaneously as boring as can be due to the movie rushing its audience to where it wants to go instead of leading viewers there through an engaging plot and empathetic characters.Look, I can\\'t write any more about this movie. Please don\\'t go see it - I know for a fact that you won\\'t enjoy it. I was disappointed beyond belief, and so bored that, if I wasn\\'t going to review this movie, I would\\'ve walked out halfway through to spare myself from any further boredom. I didn\\'t like a single thing about this movie, and I will never watch it again.',\n",
       "  \"I cannot believe that this kind of movie got a theatrical release and soon a physical media release when films like Prey, Hellraiser 2022, Fresh and more went directly into streaming ?? My main issue with prey for the devil is how basic & unoriginal it is . There is nothing new about this film , it doesn't bring anything new to the table . I hate to talk this bad about movies because as a filmmaker student I look forward to check different kind of filmmaking but doesn't mean that every film made its incredible . I do appreciate the cinematography work and you can tell they were trying their best to save this film . I guess the ones to blame here are the writers and producers.I usually enjoy possession movies , for example popular films like the conjuring movies are beautiful possession films . Prey for devil relies so much on cheap jumpscares, bad dialogue & bad characters ( which brings me to the point that i didn't believe at all that those people wanted to be studying whatever they were doing )I wish the next possession films take different turns to be unique and different cause otherwise they shouldn't be made on the first place and instead , invert that time & money on another project.\",\n",
       "  'LIKES:The Pacing: I won\\'t lie, the trailers had me less excited secondary to the editing showing it being a bit politically correct. This made me think it was going to be a very boring, in your face, slow moving movie with only a few lively moments. Not the case for me in this movie. While not the horror driven path that many movies take, Prey For the Devil (PFTD) accomplishes an entertaining pace for this reviewer that\\'s easy to watch. It moves well, helping get introductions and plot in, without sacrificing the continued progression through the story they are trying to tell. Thus, the movie is not the snore fest, talking festival, the trailers made it look like, but surprisingly a mix of speaking and exorcising balance.The Sound Editing/Effects: Much of the movie\\'s horror element comes from the effects as to the story itself, accomplishing a lot with sound and lighting alone. In regards to the audio component, PFTD utilizes the mechanic well to establish the haunting, threatening, and disturbing tone this movie has to offer. Several times the movie robs the scene of most noises, turning into a silent tomb of merely breaths, scratches, and little bumps suggesting something is coming. Other times the stakes are higher, turning the focus to impending doom sounds as the beast they are fighting uses demonic powers to turn the room into a battleground. And other times it\\'s pure chaos, where vocal inflections and beastly sounds overlay with the human voice, which truly turns into that spectacle of exorcist movies, with a little humor in it as well. The point is, the editing worked for me and was layered to give different levels of creep factor that helped build the spectacle and give the Horror element you might be looking for this weekend.The Camera Work: Again, exorcist like movies have been done a bunch and often involve the same styles of shooting the film. While this movie does borrow a lot from it, what I enjoyed was how dynamic things were with the camera element. The lighting, or in many cases hindered and lack of lighting, add to the sounds and make things feel haunted and destructive. However, we\\'ve seen those filters do their jobs and that might be nothing special to you. However, PFTD was big on dynamic action moments during the exorcising scenes and it helped pull me into the moments a little more. It wasn\\'t just stagnant shots of someone in a bed, but there was much more energy, with angles transitioning well to really give more thrills to the climactic moments. I liked the changes and the draw into the movie and felt this was a very strong element.The Story To An Extent: Surprisingly even more was the story element to this movie. A good horror for me is one part scare and one part story, with the presentation making up a big portion for both aspects. In this film, the movie made a big attempt at the story and it actually worked for me in how much deeper they went than the trailers suggested. This film is very big on diving into the central character\\'s past, and helping shape her present giving reasoning, meaning, and focus to all the things at play. It was a very engaging plot to the extent of a horror movie, helping to give most of the players involved some stronger moments and casting that I really liked. True, there is an agenda pushed in, but it\\'s tamer for me and did not get in the way of the stronger elements that the movie started to integrate into the mix. It\\'s actually this element that is one of the strongest for this movie and what I think many will enjoy.The Acting: While not the performance to clean up at the awards, the acting is not bad for this genre at all. The top billed three are my focus, but my sentence of many hitting their mark is an understatement for the talent assembled for this film. Salmon is a great leading role for the purpose of the head instructor. His voice and delivery are solid, strong, and wise, with the nonverbal mannerisms to support the relationship his character and Sister Anna have. Madsen does well with her role as the \"opposing\" factor to the school\\'s religious tone, fitting that very strong, very condescending professor. And yet, when the time requires other qualities, she shows promise with moments and delivers the dialogue well to be inspirational and meaningful. Finally the star of the show, Byers! Byers was very entertaining for me and I give the woman props for just how much she did with the role. She\\'s deep and sentimental, though not the full level I\\'ve seen in other roles, but at the same time the rebel who plays by the rules. She\\'s funny and nice, but yet has that edge to do what she needs to help people. The mixture is a nice touch and I think she did well with all elements and interactions with the acting.The \"Action\" Scenes: I said above, but the action scenes were well done in this movie that is on horror. Unlike others that tried bringing martial arts and gunplay, PFTD makes the purging of demons have more stakes and oomph than many horror movies do. The entities have personality, the stakes are high, and the character involvement for the most part crafts these moments where you really wonder who will survive the ordeal. Various strategies have to be used, objects are turned to weapons for the demon\\'s defense, and the coordination gives more movement to the scene that increases the involvement of the agents.DISLIKES:Mostly Predictable/Generic: However, the movie is rather predictable and generic. The film uses familiar tropes, plot lines with slight rehashes, and cliché circumstances that are hard to avoid in the day and age. Even the twist should have been guessed, I just wasn\\'t thinking, but you can catch many twists coming as the movie is much more simplistic and popcorn munching. It\\'s fun nonetheless, but don\\'t expect any mind blowing moments in regards to surprises.Did Not Maximize One Relationship: There is one relationship to this movie that makes is quite large for this movie. I can\\'t say much to not ruin things, but PFTD has this one dynamic that is all about Sister Ann and they only minorly address it. There are a few lines, which are cheesy, that sum up this relationship, but given everything else it paled into why this relationship existed. It\\'s not movie breaking, but it is weaker compared to all the other things we\\'ve seen.Plot Elements Having Some Holes: Going back to the relationship aspect, the movie does have other holes or convenience factors to help smooth them out. There are arguments that go unfinished, relationships left unexplored, and other elements that are shallower given the stronger relationships we have seen. It\\'s again not the worst thing I\\'ve seen, but it\\'s a shame that the movie tried to put a lot of things in only to short sight them because of the difference in directions both take that it was not surprising to have so many gaps.Not Scary For Me: It has attempts at unsettling creep factors, and it has jump scares, but my experience in this film genre makes it difficult to get me. I believe other people may jump at the tale, but overall, this is not the scariest or most disturbing movie, probably also due to the PG-13 rating. If you are going for these elements, and you have experience with the horror genre, this movie is not for you this weekend.Character Utilization: It\\'s actually better than I expected, but, again not to the full extent they could have done. There are several characters that have their place, but their inclusion feels more of an add-on, second thought, or incomplete idea compared to others. The scholar is one person, who seems to be a challenge point she\\'ll have to work with, but it\\'s really not, and sort of mitigated to helping her address her path. It\\'s not awful again, but this character needed more given all she held promise to treat. Same thing with a rival priest who seems will be a pain in the butt, but then sort of changes tune several times with little screen time. That relationship was the more annoying one, given again the potential to make stronger connections and growth.Time Got the Best Of It: This is the thing that seemed to affect most of the dislikes, was the time management. Prey for the Devil really had lots of potential, but the shortcomings seem to be due to a time issue that the 90 minutes limited them to playing with. Many things seemed rushed in, there suggested more story elements to come, but then got cut, or just trying to push so much in such little time. Even worse, it seemed to set up for a sequel, which at the end suggests that some of the aforementioned limitations were due to potentially setting up for whatever is to come later on if the directors want to do another.The VERDICT:\\nPrey for the Devil is a movie that is more story driven than horror driven which may be what most people hate with this movie. True, there is agenda writing in this film, but it does not match the aggressiveness of the ads for me, and that is a big victory in how they made the story work. It\\'s got strong character centric stories, it has interlocking arcs that are better than most plots in this genre, and it just has an engaging pace that avoids being too drawn out. I myself appreciated the visual and audio effects to make the movie have the chilling tone, with exorcism scenes that were more involved than most in the recent times. Yet, the movie is nothing special in regards to originality, it has elements that feel incomplete, and the lower rating reduced the scare factor for the extreme horror people. As such, this movie is not going to be the most renowned horror movie or our time, but it\\'s entertaining for viewers like me. Certainly there is more time needed, and I can\\'t help but think this is another franchise in the making, but overall, I quite enjoyed the movie for what was presented. My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 7.5\\nMovie Overall: 7.0.',\n",
       "  \"Prey for the Devil is one of the reasons horror films get such a bad rap.It is a very lazy film and relies on a couple of obvious jump scares to generate any kind of horror. There is no continuous suspense or drama built into the fabric of the film, which is essential for any great horror.The central conceit is fine, but just doesn't really go anywhere and isn't explored nearly enough.The characters are all pretty bland and I truly did not care for any of them. This isn't helped by the mediocre performances which don't draw you in or connect you with the characters, rendering the stakes pretty low.Ultimately this film just left no impact on me at all. I forgot about it almost as soon as I left my seat in the theatre. A good horror film should stay with you and give you at least one sleepless night, and Prey for the Devil failed to do that.\",\n",
       "  \"Absolute f knows what to say some of it was awful and some very good who knows I feel confused. I really honestly don't know what to say about this. Someone in these reviews said Smile was a better movie which is just not true at all as it's just a complete re hash of the same premise 'It Follows' has and the same goes for this. Same idea and execution of every other demonic possession horror movie you've ever seen. I honestly think that movies are that bad nowadays that my expectations are that low making titles like this seem better than they are. This will be forgotten about. Still worth a cinema date I guess but don't expect much.\",\n",
       "  \"Saw some Previews of this a couple of times, but have now seen this on this date.The film sees a nun who par-takes in an Exorcism, but finds herself way more out of her depth than she previously thought.I found the film to be mediocre, it's not amazing, but it's alright for what it is. Compared to Daniel Stamm's 2010 Last Exorcism, the latter is better.The story is ok & the visual while scary don't save this film, it's runtime of 1 hour & 26 minutes ,aren't bad but the pacing is questionable.Overall, despite the eye candy, some ok scares & some intense visuals, this is a mediocre exorcism/supernatural horror film.6/10.\",\n",
       "  'Let me say the truth. Before I watched Prey for the Devil, I expected it to be much better than this because of the many advertisements that I watched about it. But when I watched it, my hopes all went down because as I said in the title, I expected it to be much better.The only three things that can be praised in Prey for the Devil are the atmosphere and the jumpscares, the idea of a nun making an exorcism, and becoming a (SPOILER) female exorcist in the end, and the 93 minutes runtime, which was very good because the movie was not boring at all.But rather than that, everything else was very normal. The acting, story, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, and everything else was, as I wrote above, very normal, NOT BAD, but normal. So when it comes to the score, I give Prey for the Devil 5 out of 10.',\n",
       "  \"While I didn't find anything about the movie to be particularly poor, I can't really point to an area where it really excelled either. In many ways this is the absolute definition of just a stock horror film. It's almost like having been on a ride that you have been on multiple times in a row. While it's still enjoyable you've kind of already been there and done that. This quality of movie is fine for once and a while, but you wouldn't want to follow it up with a similar level film. The acting is average, but there's nothing that really draws you in to the story that makes you care deeply about any of the characters. To me that is what defines a horror flick.The ending suggests the possibility of a sequel, but I'm not sure it's earned that.\",\n",
       "  \"Yet another example of why horror is my least favourite genre. Got nothing positive to point out about this flick. It made me laugh a couple of times. Yet it wasn't supposed to.The worst offense for me personally was the recurring breaks in suspense. And it's also the reason the whole movie feels like small screen material. The movie would go on and explore the horror element, but then take a break and have characters standing outside and clearly safe for some exposition. Another mistake in my opinion. They are too quick to define the horror/unknown/evil and contain it to the ward. Thereby making any other scene feel not intimidating at all.If there's anything it excels at, it's mediocrity.\",\n",
       "  'Lets all be real. The trailer literally GIVES AWAY EVERYTHING IN YOUR FACE FOR 2 minutes. Every demon scene, every scare, and everything that happens to the characters.

I was expecting this to at least be somewhat ok, but holy ####...no...not at all. Sure didn\\'t turn out to be okay when it made me walk out. There\\'s so many things wrong with this, I can\\'t list them all. What do I even point out? Lets see, constant shaky handheld camera movement, overdone jump scares that happen every 5 minutes, priests that don\\'t act like priests, nuns that don\\'t act like nuns, CGI that looks like it was made by a high school student, characters that they would expect you to care about but you don\\'t, zero character development, sub plots that they think you would easily follow aaaaand yeah. There ya go. I\\'ve seen a lot of possession movies. Good and Bad. But THIS?! Embarrassing. Something like this should not be on a big screen, not even any streaming platform either. Maybe could pass as a little short film on YT, but other than that, no. I just don\\'t understand why the Hollywood industry does this to us. And I\\'m not only talking about them making bad movies and making their money off of us, I\\'m talking about them making almost every movie trailer 3 minutes, just to show the entire movie. If you\\'re already shown SO much in that span of time, then what\\'s the point of even going to see it in the first place? You can make an amazing trailer in just 30 seconds or a minute, not giving away much and that would be it. It\\'s not a very hard thing to do, but they act like it is.

       "  \"If you're looking for a suitable entry-level supernatural horror that checks most of the basic boxes of moodily lit, jumpscare laden catholic exorcism, this is a not too serious, not too scary PG-13 piece of work.If, however, you are looking for something more technically mature, and you are at all familiar with the genre, you're going to feel like you've seen all this somewhere before. Maybe even several somewheres. It's still worth clutching a significant other and gasping at, but you may also find yourself chuckling at the wrong moments as this cast of half-hearted priests and nuns slog through a mostly by the numbers exorcism film where everything happens just like you expect it will and the plot doesn't have to make too much sense.Jacqueline Byers.gives a muted performance as a tortured young nun with a flawed history, providing the odd tear here and there, but staying mostly on an emotional baseline, despite the ostensibly fantastic events occurring around her. Christian Navarro compliments her performance with much of the same, although he seems somewhat more genuine at times. Colin Salmon definitely takes point with tried and true acting chops, although he's relegated mostly to dialogue and exposition with little action.Without spoilers, this movie borrows possession tropes from all the big exorcism movies, dishing them out almost predictably, the most creative of which you can see in the trailers.The special FX are tame, and while the cinematography and lighting are solid most of the time, there are surprisingly odd flaws, like obvious drone shadows in the aerial shots, that really detract from the sense of being in a real theatre watching a major motion picture.Plot wise, you can guess this all the way through, and don't think too hard about things like how you can tell the difference between mental health issues and possession, how you can tell if an exorcism works or not, what exactly an exorcism requires or what the demon actually wants to accomplish by possessing someone. The movie doesn't bother to explain any of it, but acts like it does. Characters do mind-numbingly foolish things, walk into all the dark hallways go forward when they should run away, and even experience some consequences for the actions, and yet the movie seems content to leave our leads cluelessly naive and dull at each new turn of events.The moral/ethical subplots are muddy at best, making a case for women in traditionally male roles, then seemingly reinforcing why that doesn't work. It also makes a convincing argument for traditional Catholicism, then snubs it's nose at the same traditions as if unnecessary. Our heroes are mostly unsuccessful in their efforts, yet we are supposed to be on their team as they bumble through doing it their way against all better advice. In the end, I felt like the directory and his writers must have argued heavily over the religious and moral plot points, and compromised by not making any real statements or taking any sides, leaving a vacuum of blandly mixed signals that don't commit to anything other than a veiled hint that we are responsible for freeing ourselves from our own demons, but only through a confusing blend of faith, psychology and a bullheaded willingness to disregard them both and do whatever we feel like.It's a bit of a confusing mess if you want meaning, but it delivers on some jumps, some possessed characters, some inexplicable electrical failures, shadow grabs, etc.So don't be afraid to take your boyfriend and squeal on occasion, but don't expect any divine revelations. It's less like a blessed chalice of holy water and more like a stale glass of tap water.\",\n",
       "  \"Prey for the Devil is Hollywood's latest, non nonsensical woke rubbish. What worked: Strong acting, and good directing, but was not enough to make Prey for the Devil watchable. What did not work: Characters that were either casted wrong, or the makers did not write a good character for the actors. The story had gaps that are so wide. How did that ending work? How is the protagonist empowered to know so much? The boresome lecture at the end of Prey for the Devil treats the audience like a P B S kids show! Acting and directing can only take a film so far! Prey for the Devil is tired, predictable, with unbelievable flat characters. Even the ending is so so formulated, which creates a film that goes on Amazon prime quicker than most films! 3 stars.\",\n",

Computer-generated special effects are few, but what there are are poorly done. The soundtrack goes unnoticed, it\\'s as if there wasn\\'t one. The cinematography is good but in some scenes the camera movements are poorly executed. The best thing about this movie is its art direction that achieves a worthy environment for a horror movie. The script was intended to show something different and be daring, but it ended up being a cocktail of clichés, predictable scenes and a particularly bad ending.

       "  \"It's hard to shake the uneasy feeling of this film. It's grim and foggy but at the core is the idea that when trauma is passed from person to person it will consume you. With that in hand, director Parker Finn plays on the idea that most people who suffer through awful events in life will have their past consume them if they don't confront them. Dr. Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) is a clinical psychologist who surrounds herself with the mentally broken people of New Jersey (add your own joke here). You can basically connect the dots as to how she became good at her job. One fateful day a girl comes into her office and gruesomely ends her own life. That launches Sosie's journey into her own madness. Slowly seeing things in her life. Or being haunted by voices of her past. Whatever it is knows her greatest pains. And exploits it. The mystery isn't completely satisfying to solve, but the constant moments of jerky jumpscares definitely make you feel on edge.What I particularly like is the uneasy camera work. It isn't afraid to linger long within the frame. Nor add dutch angles. It plays like 70's cinema. The frames make you squirm. Though much of the scares are telegraphed. This isn't a slasher gory flick. It's really a psychological mind bender. As mentioned before, the resolution won't make you happy. But then, it really is watching someone work through their own mental illness. If that is interesting to you, this is the movie for you.\",\n",

I'm a 37-year-old man who has seen hundreds of horror flicks of all types. And yet this movie had me on edge from beginning to end. At points I was paranoid that someone was standing off to the side in the shadows of the theater. It continued afterwards, when I was startled by what turned out to be the shadow of the car behind me. And then again when the curbside lady brought my food out. I can't remember the last time a movie did this to me.I can't stop smiling at stumbling upon what might be my favorite movie of the year. I went in, as usual, without watching any trailers or looking up reviews/ratings. I had no expectations and was fully blown away. I was either smiling or had my jaw dropped for most of the runtime.I can't stop smiling at how impactful some of these scenes and moments are. I will never forget them. They are seared into my brain forever. Whoever came up with them, whoever designed them has to be some combination of genius and possibly disturbed. I love it. Maybe I'm disturbed too.I jumped about 20 times. None of the jump scares are cheap. They are all creative and earned. The few that are predictable still startle. I sometimes laughed afterwards at how bad it got me.I had a blast with Smile. It's not for the faint of heart or horror novices.

The storyline follows a psychologist in an emergency center that one day receives a unique patient who recently witnessed her college professor commit suicide. She claims something is following her and she is experiencing and seeing strange things. The doctor tries to talk her down but the woman goes from crazy, to still to killing herself with a blunt object. As the doctor tries to deal with the tragedy she notices that she is starting to experience and see strange things...This movie is written and directed by Parker Finn in his directorial debut and stars Sosie Bacon (Scream: The Series), Jessie T. Usher (The Boys), Kyle Gallner (Scream 5), Caitlin Stasey (I, Frankenstein) and Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle).This movie is very, very unique and has everything a horror genre fan is looking for. The storyline is a healthy mix of It Follows and The Conjuring. The writing is outstanding and the main character is developed perfectly - the sub plots of the dynamics of her upbringing are well told as is the nature of her relationship ship with her fiancé and her ex. Those aspects are done just enough but not too much. The scene executions are so good. There's a birthday party scene that cracked me up and was so fun. I also adored the drool scene, the mother/unveiling of the creature...and the fire sequence was well executed. There's honestly some well done jump scares in here too. The cinematography and setup of scenes in this movie are very, very good and the full circle ending was perfect.Overall, this is a brilliant addition to the horror genre that I would score a 8.5-9/10 and strongly recommend.\",\n",
       "  'I think this film\\'s getting a little more credit than it deserves. There\\'s a sense in which the threat in it is a metaphor for PTSD, but there\\'s also a very straightforward \"It Follows\"/\"The Ring\" rip-off going on, and these two elements directly clash. The film spends a lot of time on things that ultimately have no impact on the plot, so it goes into the climax having not really mapped out the nature of the threat. It\\'s unclear what it is or what would defeat it, and elements of both ideas crash into each other resulting in a fairly incoherent conclusion that seems to suggest that childhood trauma is completely insurmountable.It\\'s not a bad film. The horror sequences are mostly well-constructed and the atmosphere of creeping doubt is compelling. But, oddly enough, the central hook that the film is named for is one of those elements that is ultimately irrelevant.',\n",

It felt more real. The character acts and reacts in a genuine way we would all react if some insane situation arose.Third, it was a smooth ride. No real filler or derailing of the tense plot.So, what's the problem? It's the last 15 or so minutes. It goes in a random direction. An under devoped detail, which is more like an afterthought throughout, ends up front and center as the solution. It wasn't interesting and it wasn't the right way to go. I will say that the very last scene does give us a good payoff, though.Bottom line: I'd definitely recommend it. I think most viewers will really enjoy the bulk of the movie. I'm certain plenty of you will disagree with me regarding the ending and like it just fine. A solid 7 of 8 overall.\",\n",

None of the characters, supernatural or otherwise, seem to be any good at their jobs.This is dimwitted nonsense, but it's excellently produced.

I'm giving this a firm 8 outta 10, it really was very good!\",\n",
       "  \"What an incredible year for horror!The intro scene is conceptually perfect. Why? Because it immediately gives us all that we need to get into the context of the film, not only in terms of the most classic horror elements but also in terms of its main themes. All this before its title card. But how? Introducing us immediately to our main character, Dr Rose Cotter, who works in a psychiatric hospital and who receives a visit from a new patient who in ten minutes shows strange behaviour, claims to be being followed by an evil entity, smiles scarily and commits suicide. And now that curse seems to have passed on to our Dr., who is impeccably played by Sosie Bacon, in one of those roles where she often has to balance herself on the boundary that separates what everyone sees and what only she can see.Trauma. It will always be traumatic to witness an event as dramatic and violent as a suicide. And it is from trauma that this entity feeds. And how well this theme is used... after all, many of us have gone through traumas and traumas are just kept in a hidden corner within us, always ready to be reactivated. Grief and guilt are often associated with traumatic events, and Smile does not deny that connection. Nor does it refuse to make connections with psychological and mental problems that can arise from it and how when this happens, the victim becomes even more placed on the sidelines, more isolated, more alone in a world from which one does not intend to move away but from which finds no other alternative.But of course, this is a horror movie and it's not only about the message that a film of the genre should live. Good news: even if you don't care about meaning, Smile is pretty good and effective entertainment. The suspenseful scenes are very well constructed, the environment feels heavy for long moments and it presents us with several jump scares that work perfectly, being this one of the scariest films of recent years.The film suffers from a certain predictability typical of the genre - I saw that ending coming from miles away - and, at times, it seems to rely a little too much on the power of suggestion and the effectiveness of its scares, although there are reasons for that because those are two areas where it stands out. The visual effects - mostly practical - are not present for long moments, but when they appear they elevate the work, with some really terrifying images. And as for Parker Finn...what a great movie debut, not only because of the way he leaves us on edge thanks to a very safe direction but also for presenting some elements that we don't often see in horror in terms of the originality of shots and scene transitions.2022 doesn't stop giving us good horror. Smile bets on a heavy atmosphere, strong messages and very effective scares to give us one of the tensest films of the year. A little bit The Ring, a little bit It Follows, but also a very own identity that should ensure this will not stop here.\",\n",
       "  'I was pretty hyped for this movie, not going to lie. I wasn\\'t expecting some 11-time Oscar winning masterpiece, but I did expect an intense, edge-of-your-seat scarefest like that of \\'Insidious\\' or \\'Sinister\\', where the movie is dripping with creepy unsettlingness from start to finish. \\'Smile\\' is not that. What \\'Smile\\' does well is build up the jump scare, but unfortunately (and more importantly), \\'Smile\\' forgets to deliver the scare in each of these sequences it repeats throughout its way overlong 2-hour runtime.Example, the main character will be staring down a dark hallway while the music tenses and camera slowly zooms in, and then the phone will ring SO LOUD. This is NOT a scare! This is just lazy and, above all, annoying. These \"jump scares\" happen throughout the ENTIRE movie and are extremely obnoxious. I can respect jump scares if there\\'s actually something scary at the end of the build-up, not just an obnoxiously loud noise that has nothing to do with the tension that was just wasted. An example of an ACTUAL jump scare would be like when the Lipstick Demon appears at the table for the first time in \\'Insidious\\'. THAT is a warranted jump scare.The plot of \\'Smile\\' and the way the characters unravel it is almost identical to \\'The Ring\\'. No new ground is broken, which was expected, but I at least expected a little more originality than a copy/paste story of \\'The Ring\\' with a good amount of \\'It Follows\\' copied as well, yet is far less than both those movies.What I thought was pretty good was the ending, when the demon finally reveals itself. The design of the demon and what it does to its victims is actually pretty great/gruesome. Unfortunately, by the time we\\'re introduced to the Smile demon, the movie\\'s over. Such a shame, as this movie could have been a balls-to-the-wall nail-biting chiller. The score for this movie was hands-down the best and creepiest part. The music reminded me of \\'Sinister\\'s music, as in there was something off about it, making it unnerving.Overall, this movie has been done before and done MUCH better. Has it\\'s moments, but drags on without any scares for far too long.6/10.',\n",
       "  \"Smile is a new horror film directed and written by Parker Finn. After some short films, this is only his first real directing work.The film is about psychologist Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) who learns about a dark evil after a traumatic event with a new patient.This same evil continues to frighten and endanger her after this event. To stop this evil, she must learn its origins, but in doing so she is confronted with her own traumatic past.Film studio Paramount has tried to keep this film a bit of a secret and only promoted it with a hidden teaser on some films. Once the trailer hit the internet, it received a lot of positive attention. Because of this, the film studio decided to release the film in theaters, because at first the film would only be released on their streaming service. For example, they eventually had novice director Parker Finn direct this film and had it come up with a suitable story.For a first film, Parker Finn manages to portray the film beautifully and appropriately. He knows how to create creative transitions between some scenes. The images can only come across as somewhat familiar to horror fans, because many scenes come across in similar ways to scenes from other films, especially well-known horror films.Despite Parker Finn's good work, Paramount could have arranged for some extra people to give him some extra support. The story of the film is good, but not really original. Horror connoisseurs can quickly compare the story with stories from other horror films such as The Ring of It Follows. For example, the film can at times become a bit predictable for horror connoisseurs, who can then roughly predict what will happen in the film and thus anticipate the story itself.Parker Finn knows how to create a good tension with the way in which he manages to portray things together with an appropriate soundtrack and further frightening sounds. Unfortunately, this often only leads to a simple jump scare. After the umpteenth time, this can start to seem faint rather than being really scary. This allows the film to lose its tension level a bit.Parker Finn does try to bring out some other horror ways during the end of the film, but these are no longer as strong or frightening. If he had been more creative earlier in the movie with different horror elements, the movie could have been better and scarier. Around the end, he also seems to lose some of his focus, so that all of a sudden everything happens and seems to be possible.Despite the fact that Sosie Baconmeer is known as a TV actress, she knows how to deliver good and appropriate acting in this film. She comes across as someone who continues to be plagued by evil and must try to relive her traumatic past. She knows how to carry the film well, because the rest of the film cast is also more actors from TV series or small film roles. Most of them play their roles well, but with most of their characters it is possible to predict what will happen to them.\",\n",

We also get the lacklustre, conveyer belt jump scares we've seen a million times, and to top it off we get the yawn inducing family drama to make you feel like you're actually watching a movie, and it was putting me to sleep. If this movie was meant to be a wink wink type of horror movie then don't make it this serious. And if you are trying to make something like this serious then there's a way to also make it come off as satirical to the horror genre. I don't know what this movies' direction was. Was this made to help the studio write off something on their taxes? Was it some directorial debut for a director or lead actor?, cause it didn't do them any favours.

But other effects are pretty good, even unintentionally funny at times. Having watched Barbarian recently (10/10), Smile could have used some of that \"humor\" because any humor in smile is unintentional, whereas Barbarian is very surgical. Smile, from a concept level, is interesting following in the footsteps of The Ring and It Follows, but Smile doesn\\'t check off all the boxes to get to a 10/10.

Cops need to be totally incompetent and oblivious as well.The protagonist is extremely unlikable, but the movie tries to convince me that I should be rooting for her. This movie tells me that she's not crazy, but the character acts totally insane. There's a strange disconnect between what the movie wants me to think and what it shows me. There are jump scares that have nothing to do with the movie and come out of nowhere just for the sake of adding a jump scare.To top everything off, it's extremely predictable and I saw the ending coming from a mile away. It wasn't scary either. I found everything quite boring. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who's like me and can't turn their brain off.

We have all the cliché here: a woman lose her job because she is possessed by something since the young lady killed herself in front of her. And we have the separation from her sister, husband and even her psy. The jumpscares are there but the story was pretty simple and to know more about the possession trough the other cases is good but clearly not enough to hide all the classic parts of an horror movie.

I started closing my eyes because the jump scares were so predictable, and I was tired of having disturbing images screamed in my face. I will say that Sosie Bacon did an excellent job with what she was given, with her performance being the only bright spot in the film.

This movie has some physical horror, a sense of dread, a couple of shock moments (the best one used in the trailer), loud sudden sounds and, most horrifying of all, the smiles. It's amazing how scary a smile can be.The largely unknown cast is good. And writer/director Parker Finn has done a great job on his first feature.

The faces usually smilie and soon it consumes her to the point of suicide. She then researches this demonic situation to something more horrific. There were a few abrupt scenes that I would've like more of a scene before it cuts to the next, but it was honestly disturbing and unexpected in its timing of scares.

       "  \"Just came back after a viewing of this & wow, this film is one of the examples of Trailers looking better than the actual film itself.The film sees a mental health doctor who after witnesses a suicide of a patient right in front of her eyes who grins in a sinister way & describes a supernatural force prior. However, this entity has soon attached itself to her & begins to ruin every aspect of her life. She must investigate in order to stop whatever it is that has attached itself to her.I found the film to be mostly boring. Ok, it had some gory, creepy & sinister moments in it, but, for a film with such a basic & thin premise with little to no depth, it was too long!!! 1 hour & 50 minutes!! The film could've easily have been 30 minutes shorter fro crying out loud!The story & it's premise was so basic & out there that it wasn't even that intriguing! The trailer made the film seem better than it actually was sadly! The ending man, the ending was just out there!! The film dragged on for literally nothing & why!? It! Makes! No! Sense!Also, the death of the cat was unneeded as well as other stuff...! You know what I mean...!Overall, it's simple unimaginative story & concept that's a wannabe of Truth or Dare, which is far better by the way! The deaths are ok (apart from the opening kill which was ace) & the film itself feels like a forgettable after thought!3/10.\",\n",
       "  \"I really expected the movie to live up to the hype it was portraying. Hopefully this is not the directors first and only movie filmed cause if it is, I'm giving up before getting started. The buildup was not bad. Plot and Climax was mediocre. Very underwhelming acting. I will say the ending was decent. Was not expecting it. I put this under more of a psychological thriller then horror. I caught MAYBE three jump scares. Quite a bit of gore which I don't mind but it seemed to be trying to give off a message that I feel this day and age society won't grasp. I personally don't recommend it but to each their own. A lot of people supposedly love it. To each their own. Definitely need a refund back from my firestick.\",\n",
       "  '\"Smile\" is the scariest sh-t I\\'ve seen in a while. It\\'s probably the scariest movie I\\'ve seen since \"Hereditary.\" I gotta hand it to Parker Finn, he was in his bag. He took a known formula and suped it up to effectively give the audience something new. He had me squirming and on edge the whole time like a rollercoaster rider who knows the drop is coming but still has their heart in their throat once it happens.The basic premise is an oft-used one, and in fact, I thought this movie was going to be a different version of \"Truth or Dare\" (2018) which was not all that good. In \"Smile\" people were serially committing suicide only after they\\'d witnessed someone else commit suicide.A psychologist by the name of Rose Cotter (Sosie Bacon) witnessed a girl (Caitlin Stasey) commit suiced right in front of her by cutting her own throat--all with a sardonic smile on her face. It was traumatic, but Rose thought she could push past such a gruesome event and continue doing her job as a therapist.Wrong.What Rose didn\\'t know was that now she was the target of whatever malevolent being caused her patient to kill herself. From that point on she would slowly devolve into a state of sheer psychosis as she was plagued by something only she, AND WE, could see.\"Smile\" was this awesome blend of eerie, chilling, nerve-wracking, and plain scary. There was this pervasive eeriness that hung over the movie like San Francisco fog which I think helped make the jump scares have maximum impact. Look, I\\'ve seen HUNDREDS of scary movies and I know all of the jump scare setups, and still this movie got me a few times.So hats off to writer/director Parker Finn, and hats off to Sosie Bacon. Sosie Bacon did a heckuva job as the main character. The cast overall was solid: Jessie T. Usher (A-Train in \"The Boys), Kal Penn (Kumar from \"Harold & Kumar\"), Kyle Gallner, and Robin Weigert of note, but this was Sosie\\'s show and she owned it.',\n",

       " ['To give context to how little I cared about HALLOWEEN ENDS (2022), the \"conclusion\" to this now bloated, confusing, retconned franchise, I completely forgot that it was coming out this year. When I saw trailers on YouTube recently, I was thinking it was coming out some time next year. Also, I literally found out on the SAME DAY it was premiering that it was available on Peacock! And I was like, it\\'s Halloween month, this is (supposedly) the final Halloween film, I have time to spare, so I\\'ll give it a go. Maybe my low expectations will be countered with something remotely decent. And, honestly, this movie might actually be worse than the atrocious predecessor Halloween Kills! It\\'s that bad. Looking very cheap and less cinematic than the prior 2 entries, Halloween Ends tells what feels like an incredibly random story that could have been any throwaway sequel from the 80s.Inexplicably, this movie opts to focus on a completely new character Corey and the filmmakers chose one of the most boring and annoying horror movie protagonists/antagonists that I can recall in recent memory. In the film\\'s pre-credits scene set on Halloween night of 2019, Corey accidentally killed the kid he was babysitting for and spends the rest of the movie, set in 2022, being the town pariah. The film opens with an interesting premise that the Haddonfield citizens are so paranoid about Michael Myers that they implode and turn on each other, but it never really followed through with it. Instead, we get all these weird scenes of random citizens verbally attacking the main characters Corey and the Strodes for being the cause of all the evil and killings. What\\'s odd is that even though Laurie (once again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) was barely a blip in Kills, even though she gets a lot more screentime in Ends, she still feels like a bit player.As I said, it focuses on this new character Corey, who ends up in a forbidden romance with Laurie\\'s annoying granddaughter Allyson (reprised by Andi Matchak), the most useless character in this recent retconned trilogy of films. I couldn\\'t stand Allyson in the 2018 movie or Kills, and Ends just confirms my belief that Allyson was nothing more than a terrible plot device in the trilogy. In H2018 and Kills, she just a random nuisance who got caught up in the action while Laurie (in H2018) and Karen (in Kills) were the proactive badasses who got things done. Then Laurie gets sidelined while Karen gets killed off, while Allyson gets to hang around and continue to be useless. In Ends, this time it\\'s Corey who gets to be proactive while Allyson is just his love interest. Somehow, this girl is a filler love interest after she\\'s been in 2 movies, while the new guy gets to be the lead. Shows how uninteresting she is. Also, Lindsay is in this movie for no reason whatsoever than to exist, just like she did in Kills.But the worst offense in this movie is how little Michael got to do. For some reason, he\\'s been hiding out under a bridge for the last 4 years since the tragic events of H2018/Kills and no one has even caught him yet. Then he only re-surfaces when Corey gets thrown over the bridge by those 4 juvenile delinquents, who for some reason are dressed like it\\'s still the 1970s. So he takes Corey in as his apprentice and the duo tag teams it for a while until Corey decides he wants to be the alpha and incapacitates Michael stealing his mask and taking over being the main killer. To top off this weirdness, Allyson basically stays with Corey knowing how sick he is. He literally tells her that he killed a person and her first instinct is to comfort him and go on a date! No reporting the crime to the police...she just wants to keep making out with him. The duo have all these weird scenes where Allyson is all like she\\'s drawn to him and they were meant to be together.In fact, the tone of this entire movie was strange with a terrible supporting cast of unlikable characters. I know it\\'s a \"small\" town, but what was with all these random moments of people running into Laurie, Corey, and Allyson and spewing out judgment on them? There was that grocery store parking lot scene where the lady scolded Laurie for being the cause of Michael slashing her cousin\\'s throat (how did that old lady survive Kills?), the 4 teen bullies always running into and bullying Corey, the creepy cop (who looks twice her age) hitting on Allyson, the couple whose kid Corey accidentally killed just show up randomly in the bar including the father delivering that weird monologue, Corey\\'s strict and holier-than-thou mother, and his boss/stepfather\\'s odd line \"I hope you find love\"? So much weird dialogue in this movie. Then there were filler characters like Allyson\\'s co-workers: the sleazy doctor and the mouthy nurse. Were they supposed to be comic relief?The climax made no sense. Laurie shoots Corey a couple of times, then purposefully shoots the wall using up her bullets, lets him grab a knife to supposedly kill her. But she literally said a few minutes ago \"Did you think I was going to kill myself?\" He stabs himself and then she\\'s sad about it? He just tried to kill her. Of course the plot deviced Allyson walks in and assumes Laurie killed him and then drives away then gets a call from Hawkins (played again by Will Patton) who asks about Laurie because she called about a suicide, so she goes back. Didn\\'t Allyson realize that was a hoax? She just saw Laurie standing over Corey\\'s body with a knife. Why would Laurie commit suicide when she just stopped her assailant? Also, why would Laurie tell someone she was going to kill herself? Then Michael pops up, Laurie battles him, gets the upper hand, then slows around and killer talks him until he can grab her throat, Allyson shows up, she runs her mouth unnecessarily, they don\\'t finish him and instead wait for the police and entire town to parade Michael\\'s body to the junkyard where they mutilate his body. The End.There were several times where I kept looking at how much time was left in this tedious film because that\\'s how bored and frustrated I was. The first 30 minutes felt like an hour. By the 50-minute mark, there was a whole hour left and I couldn\\'t believe it because the movie felt so slow and random with such an unimpressive cast of characters. There was actually one decent scene in the entire movie (thus the extra star) and that was the scene between Laurie and Hawkins in the grocery store. It was actually well-written and acted by Curtis and Patton, but then the movie followed it with randomness, just like virtually every other moment in the film. Kills and now this film Ends are so bad, it\\'s making me appreciate H2018 even more because that movie had some cohesion, tension, buildup, and horror and a smashing ending, even though it had it\\'s share of cringe moments indicative of modern writing and filmmaking. But Kills and Ends are just cringe films start to finish. It\\'s hard to believe that this is how the storied franchise is actually going to end. They\\'ll probably reboot/remake it again for like the 5th time. They may have to because this film is not the right note to go out on.',\n",
       "  \"For a movie that promotes the final showdown between Laurie and Michael, it's very head scratching that Myers doesn't make his first on screen appearance to almost 45 mins into the film. That was a really bad sign. The movie really centers around Corey, not Michael nor Laurie for that matter. It's about his severe struggles with reality and how he continues to unravel from a freak babysitting accident. The film does do a decent job of making you root for the guy and all the people who were pricks to him look to get their comeuppance. But again, way too much time was spent on Corey and not Michael and Laurie. The last scene though was a very creative way to put everybody's mind at rest that this time Michael is certainly NOT coming back. I would say the movie as a whole was disappointing but I'd be lying if I said I was expecting it to be great before watching it. Most people I'm sure would agree.\",\n",

Kills was a letdown and this was the final nail in the coffin!This movie introduces an entirely new storyline and character, which is not the way you close off a trilogy! The concept around this is interesting enough, but as a conclusion to a long running franchise, it could not have been more bafflingly misplaced!Micheal Myers is reduced to a cameo and the final confrontation comes out of nowhere, with NO build up or satisfaction! The confrontation in 2018 was better than this! It is clear that there were not material enough for a trilogy so why? Oh Yeah.... money.',\n",
       "  \"I hope the next installment will forget about arthouse Halloween, and be back to the normal timeline. Halloween was never a psychological thriller. It was just a silly slasher flick, with stereotypical characters, and an unbelievably resistant vilain. Just like previous installments of this trilogy, Halloween Ends, takes itself too seriously, without having something to back it up. Sometimes it felt like a cheap soap, other times, like reality TV. Or a bad play, with uncomfortable chairs. And people telling their boring live, and sharing their feelings, to each other, and us... And when the horror kicked in, it made you laugh more than it should've. With the way it couldn't be effectively scary. I didn't mind the « new approach » but was it really one? Because at the end of the day, it still felt like the same all over again. And why make the kill count so unsympathetic? What's the point in watching a slasher movie, where you can't wait for characters to die. I liked the finale showdown between Michael and Laurie, but they felt like two people who fight for divorce at that point. Which is why the siblings connection gave their encounters, more depth and meaning, in previous « no more canon » installments. I was getting sick of Laurie's victim/survivor rambling, or was it Jamie Lee's? But I liked that end voice over. It was in par with the rest of the idea behind this new side of the story. But why did they had to end Ends like a Tarantino movie? And why the parallel between Michael and Corey? Like they said in 2018, he picked her randomly, so making it look like Laurie was trying to prevent Allyson her own disappointment, was too random and far fetched. They just were full of ideas, but weren't good enough filmmakers to make it all stick. Sorry, but that's just the way I feel. I cringed every time Kyle Richards appeared onscreen. Just because she was in the first Halloween, doesn't mean she had to be there too. It made Haddonfield feel a lot more like a hillbilly town, than it appeared to be in the original movie. Maybe it's the end for this heroine, but I doubt studios will allow this to be the last of the series. So see you in a couple of years, and don't mind me pretending it ended with H20.\",\n",

Corey gets flustered and kicks the attic door open, accidentally knocking Jeremy over the bannisters to land in a bloody heap at the feet of his parents, who have just arrived home.Corey is released but becomes a local pariah, someone for the people of Haddonfield to demonise now that Michael Myers isn't around. Except that Michael is around. He's been living in the sewers like a ninja turtle, presumably feeding on rats and poo. Or rat poo. After Corey is pushed off a bridge by local bullies, he is dragged underground by Michael, but Myers doesn't kill him: instead, they become best buds and go on a killing spree, which is bad news for Laurie Strode's granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) who has just started dating Corey. Fortunately, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) has seen something in Corey's eyes that makes her believe that he is going down a dark path, but can she convince Allyson that her boyfriend is evil before it is too late?I went into Halloween Ends with the mindset 'How can director David Gordon Green possibly make a worse movie than Halloween Kills?'. I've just found out.The film kicks things off with a pre-credits sequence that made me wonder whether this was going to be a comedy, and it just gets worse. And worse. And worse. Each time I thought the film couldn't be any more insulting to horror fans, Green does the seemingly impossible.From the moment they show the metal crusher in the junkyard where Corey works, it's obvious that Michael will be reduced to mincemeat at the end. Less predictable is just how little Michael actually features in the film: this is a Halloween movie, so one might reasonably expect Myers to play a big part, but the series' iconic killer only makes brief appearances, the bulk of the film revolving around Corey. This is not what fans want!But it's not just the lack of Myers that makes this film a total failure: there's the awful script, which offers up more groan-worthy dialogue and godawful moments than its predecessor, something that I didn't think was even possible. Michael and Corey becoming pals is dreadful (I half expected to see Michael riding pillion on Corey's motorcycle), but for me the worst bits are when Corey tells Allyson that he has killed someone and she doesn't bat an eyelid, or when Laurie decides to pull the knife out of Corey's neck after he has stabbed himself, just as Allyson walks in through the door, leading the girl to believe that her gran has killed her boyfriend. Doh!After the inevitable and risible showdown between Laurie and Michael, and the disposing of the maniac's body in that grinder, the film finally ends, leaving David Gordon Green to focus on destroying another horror classic, The Exorcist (why does he hate horror fans so much? What have we ever done to him?).\",\n",

You're watching the thirteenth installment of a simple and good film made 44 years ago. Michael Myers has become a blood-transmitted disease, and Halloween is now a self-meta pseudophilosophical parody nightmare.The time-space continuum was broken, and Haddonfield now exists in two temporal realities simultaneously - 1978 and 2019. People act like videogame NPCs, you press the interaction key, and they speak in random text lines or do random things.There are many scenes in this film, none of which are connected in any way but are very diverse in nature. There was some good gore, and funny parody sketches with actors almost laughing on set.The film almost drove me into an epileptic seizure 30 minutes in, but then Shaft showed up, and things got really cool.In all seriousness, it seems to me that the script was assembled from scraps of something else, most likely a gritty thriller set in the '70s setting. They took some scene ideas and just slapped them over the tired Halloween routine.There is one more possibility, though. They probably wanted to pull off a Matrix sequel, making it bad and saying it was made that way deliberately. But this only works once, and they already did it with The Matrix Resurrections. So, intentionally making it trash doesn't justify anything.Overall rating - garbage fire/10. Looking forward to more sequels.\",\n",
       "  \"Wow, what a mess of a trilogy. I can't believe what started off as an interesting new take on a horror icon devolved into such a cliched and anticlimatic conclusion. Whoever handed the reigns over to David Gordon Green needs to be fired and blacklisted. Again, Green proves that he just cannot make a mainstream film. From the camera work right down to his actors performances(and these are good actors he's working with), he just cannot break from his indie roots, and I believe this really hurt the new trilogy. Look at the stark difference in directorial style from the first film in this trilogy compared to the other two and that will give you a bit of a clue as to what happened with production. The producers put far too much trust into their director, and the end result was catastrophic. Somebody, anybody, should have told him that most of this material makes no sense with the rest of the storyline and that nobody cares about any of these characters other than Michael Myers.I have many questions for Mr. Green. Such as, why did he decide Lorie Strode needed to be a narrator that sounded similar to a Jane Austen novel? Or, Why did you think giving Michael Myers a partner, or even thinking that someone would have the same evil inside them as he does, would be a good idea? Scratch that, why is Michael Myers not immortal and just going complete psycho killer on everyone, including the guy he ends up helping? And how are 2 women who weigh maybe about 90 lbs soaking wet could over power him in such a way? Also, if he's not immortal, how in the hell did he survive a house fire, get injured(shot, stabbed, etc.) and kill a bunch of people all in the same night, only to go into hiding for 4 years and somehow take care of his wounds and not die? I get that it is just a movie, but make it make sense!Not to mention, what is the deal with the political statements in the movie? Did the horror film about a maniac who wants to kill everything in his path to killing his family really need an overt political statement being made throughout? I personally don't and it, just like many, many other things, didn't even gel well in terms of the story. I also feel like I need to address the fact that this finale seems to forget it's a horror movie until about the last 15-20 mins. There are 2 kills in the first 80 mins, and then the end was just as unimpressive with the kills as the first 80 mins. I'd say it was on par with the last Scream film in terms of violence. Nowhere near the brutal deaths of Kills or, because it's fresh from last weekend, Terrifier 2.Overall, this has to be the worst in the franchise right next to Kills. Even Halloween: Resurrection was better than this. At least they knew how to stick with their own lore about Michael Myers. This final installment seems to forget everything about him, included the lore that was being set up by this trilogy. I suppose that's something I'm impressed by. Never seen a planned trilogy of a well known franchise ditch ideas from previous films in said trilogy. They're usually more planned than this slapdash effort. I do not think the Halloween franchise will ever recover from this.½ a butcher knife out of 5.\",\n",

They knew this movie would have been a box office bomb if fans had the slighest hint of how the CC character would actually play out. We the fans were duped into thinking we were going to see a great final installment of a trilogy, when it was anything but.Despite the awful and laughable 'amateur hour' script, the movie was still boring. And worst of all, on top of everything else, there was not one single scary scene. MM was a feeble and weak after thought in his own movie. So are we supposed to be scared of Corey Cunningham in a childs plastic scarecrow mask?! Seriously?!?!Shame on everyone that was apart of this! The movie was an absolute DISGRACE!!!\",\n",
       "  'This will be a short review as I genuinely don\\'t want to give this film any more time than I already have.Writing is terrible, cringe worthy, and forgettable. The dialogue just had me saying \"shoot yourself\" and \"people don\\'t talk like this\" multiple times. I suppose the nicest thing I can say for this film is that it looked good and the kills were bloody and messy, also a certain subplot I liked but I\\'ll get to that later. The kills though they were also downright hilarious.Which will lead me to say this film only escapes being a 1 because of how much I was laughing. It was like a train wreck that I couldn\\'t stop watching.Now for the subplot which I will not spoil, I will say that at first it had me rolling my eyes but as the film progressed it was getting more outlandish and because of that I came around to this plot line and just wanted them to go all the way with it. If they have I would\\'ve just been dying in my theater seat.Anyway this is exactly how I anticipated Halloween Ends to be especially after Kills, the only relief I have is that it\\'s finally over. At least until the inevitable Halloween reboot/remake.IMDb: 2/10\\nLetterboxd: 2/5Watched in Theaters.',\n",
       "  'Spoiler alert... This was beyond terrible. People always talk about how bad Halloween Resurrection is, at least Michael Myers is in Resurrection. This was the Friday the 13th Part 5 of the Halloween franchise. And Laurie can just take him out with a few stabs? Yet in the previous movies (2018 & H Kills) he was shot multiple times, stabbed with a pitchfork, ran over, left in a house set on fire, beat to death and shot by the whole town and he still got back up ... but Laurie and a kitchen knife were no match for Michael. This movie is complete garbage. The few kills shown were in the trailer (of course) and 90% of them weren\\'t even Michael. What a strange opening, we should feel sorry for the babysitter that turns murderer? Michael lives in the sewer?

They were not made by true Halloween fans and were not made for true Halloween fans.These filmmakers had far too much freedom with a franchise with a rich history...and it shows.What a sad way to see an empty, lifeless and meaningless end to such a character.I can\\'t even begin to convey how insanely inept it is to see the \"emotional\" climax with booming John Carpenter music and its the first glimpse of an actual Halloween movie but there\\'s only 3 minutes of movie left.They forgot to build up to the climax...the climax they wanted to move you with yet not guide you to.Stupid stupid stupid writing and directing.The dialogue was cringy and nothing that any self-respecting humans would ever say out loud. There are moments when we should just be shown emphasis on something when imstead we get spoon-fed awful words to make certain our dumb brains know what\\'s going on. The characters go against their nature just to make the story move, the story that seems to have been written the day before shooting. And they forgot that the last movie of a trilogy should sum up the characters from the previous installments and not resemble the first movie of a new trilogy.OH, and they forgot this movie is about Michael Myers too.

Don\\'t buy it one bit, because I am sure Hollywood already has plans to \"reboot\" the series in a few years, doing the same old \"we are going to ignore all the sequels and only take the first one\" plot again. They did that with Halloween H20, and then they did it again in 2018.This is just the same old thing over and over again guys, there is no difference. The worst thing is that this movie is 100% false advertising. It is two different things, it is a weird teenage dating movie, then becomes a slasher towards the tale end. Don\\'t believe the advertising, Michael Myers is barely in this thing.The Halloween series is like the Nightmare on Elm Street series, the first one is a masterpiece, then everything else is just silly, unnecessary, and lame (Halloween 3 was all right though).If you must watch this, watch it for free using a friends account or whatever. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as always, but they just make her do the same thing and the same old \"I\\'m a tough S. O. B. And I ain\\'t scared of Michael Myers\" attitude that she has had since the 2018 movie. Her tough woman talk is just kinda old at this point, we get it she has become \"Sarah Connor\" from \"Terminator 2.\"The 2018 movie was a good return, but to be 1000% honest, Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends are just straight up cash grabs.

       " [\"Greetings again from the darkness. Don't look away. Whether referring to Mamie Till-Mobley telling family members to look at the disfigured boy in the casket, or to the general counsel to all citizens in this day of division, the sentiment is the same ... see with your own eyes so that you understand the injustice. Writer-director Chinonye Chukwu (CLEMENCY, 2019) and her co-writers Michael Reilly and Keith Beauchamp allow us to see the tragic story of Emmett Till through the eyes of his mother, and it's a powerful approach. It's Mr. Beauchamp who has diligently researched this story for almost 25 years, and was the driving force behind the 2005 documentary, THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL.The film certainly benefits from the powerhouse performance of Danielle Deadwyler (THE HARDER THEY FALL, 2021) as Mamie Till-Mobley. Mamie's love and concern for her 14-year-old son Emmett (a terrific Jalyn Hall) is only surpassed by her strength and dignity after his death ... and all of this is masterfully portrayed by Ms. Deadwyler in her surefire Oscar contending role. We see just enough of young Emmett to realize he's a well-raised, considerate, and fun-loving boy who sometimes stutters. He's so excited for his trip from Chicago to Mississippi to meet some of his relatives, while seeing and doing new things. It's 1955, and Mamie tries to caution Emmett on the differences between their world at home and the southern world he's about to enter.There are varying accounts of what Emmett actually did or didn't do to Money, Mississippi store clerk Carolyn Bryant (played by Haley Bennett, SWALLOW, 2019), but the shock of seeing Emmett's disfigured face and body is handled brilliantly here, and though the actual violence occurs off screen, the impact remains. Against all of her motherly protective instincts, Mamie seizes the power of the moment to have a photograph taken and demand an open casket so that the world can witness the result of the atrocity. Her ability to think clearly catapulted the case to national attention, and allowed Emmett Till to become a name and example that is still studied today.The supporting cast includes Frankie Faison (Mamie's father), Whoopi Goldberg (Mamie's mother), Sean Patrick Thomas, Tosin Cole (as Medgar Evers), John Douglas Thompson, and Jayme Lawson. The trial of the men accused of beating and killing Emmett plays a part here, but the only real courtroom drama occurs when Mamie takes the stand. It's in that moment when Ms. Deadwyler truly shines and allows us to feel a mother's pain and disgust. Afterwards, we get a taste of her activism ... something she continued until her death in 2003 at age 81. Filmmaker Chukwu benefits from the performance of Deadwyler and the years of research by Mr. Beauchamp, and she delivers a film that allows us to experience a dark moment in history from a different perspective - the eyes of a mother.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.\",\n",
       "  \"Let me just start off by saying the lead performance was outstanding. There's not a parent in the world who could even begin to imagine what the Till family endured. Nor would any parent ever want to deal with so much pain.While the movie takes certain liberties-it's still a movie, the story behind the real life event stayed true.I found the movie hard to watch at times being a father and biracial myself along with biracial children. The story comes down to a mother's simple quest for justice in the murder of her son. To those not familiar with Emmit Till's story, I urge you to look it up for yourself.Danielle Deadwyler plays Till's mother and she gives a knockout performance rivaling anyone who's won an academy award. In fact, I'd say she would be the front runner this year for best actress. Like I said, it's a hard watch but terrific movie nonetheless.\",\n",
       "  \"I wasn't fully immersed in it, like I could tell I was watching a movie, it didn't make me feel like I was part of it or lost in the story. Pretty slow, especially first part of the movie. Maybe the fact that this was a true story makes it hold more weight because I wasn't really moved by the movie itself, gives it emotional value as it's very important in American black history.Only problem is the story went how I thought it would, so it just feels like one that you've already heard before. If you're already invested in the what the movie has to tell beforehand, then you might appreciate it more. I thought it would be something new and intriguing, instead it's different characters and setting but same stories and similar ones have already been told better(sad reality that they're commonplace).It carries an important message, just unfortunate it wasn't told as best as it could've been. It just leans so much on the pain the mother and story carries in order to move you. It's not half bad, it's just a movie that needs you to already believe in the message to elevate it from just a decent movie into an astonishing one. But because of the emotional value it has, it might still received very favorably by some, maybe even most.\",\n",
       "  '\"If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.\" Desmond Tutu\"Handle with Care\" could have been on the cover of the script for Till, but it wasn\\'t necessary because director Chinonye Chukwu, following her Sundance-winning Clemency, crafts her gentle but powerful depiction of 14-year-old Emmett Till\\'s Mississippi lynching in 1955 and the subsequent trial of two white men. This docudrama not only does justice to the tragedy, but it also shows the death\\'s influence on the 1967 Civil Rights Act.Mamie Till-Mobley (Danielle Deadwyler in a sure-to-be-Oscar nominated performance) fights to have her son\\'s brutalized body shown to the public, and it was shown, and like the movie itself, unforgettable. The film shoots this struggle in bright color as if to proclaim the horror vividly to the world. While strong black men recoiled from facing down white supremacists, Mamie never backed down in her attempt to bring justice for her son and expose the bigotry that exists even today.While sometimes the music is heavy-handed and the courtroom drama veers to conventionality, never does the script waver from an even-keeled tempo, that like the Civil Rights Movement itself edges inexorably to success, the only possible outcome when justice is on its side. Although the material may be too emotionally sensitive for some, most will appreciate the unsentimental, unsensational, respectful delivery.Emmett\\'s famously bloated and disfigured face haunted us almost 70 years ago from the pages of Jet magazine, and it is no less disturbing now in Till. It\\'s just that we have matured enough to face down realism for the greater good of facing down racism.\"We do the best we can.\" MamieOne of the year\\'s best movies.',\n",
       "  \"Historically, when the name 'Till' is cited, it generally refers only to Emmett, the 14 year old boy who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955. Chinonye Chukwu's TILL seeks to have audiences also respect the memory of Emmett's proud mother, Mame Till-Mobley.In many ways, TILL is a fairly straightforward Bio-pic. Chukwu's script (with a pair of co-writers) carefully traces the days leading up to Emmett's (Jalyn Hall) fateful trip from his native Chicago down to Mississippi to visit his cousins. Mame (Danielle Deadwyler) knows the dangers and does her best to warn the teen. As history shows, a tragedy worse than his mother could have possibly imagined occurs when a white woman, Carolyn (Haley Bennett), accuses young Emmett of impropriety. After Emmett''s murder, Mame bravely travels to Mississippi to confront her son's accusers and testify on his behalf.The film is quite accurate to the events, even if some of the screenplay falls into familiar Bio-pic traps - a certain overly prettified period look, an overblown score and preachy dialogue that speaks from the present day rather than to what was happening then and there. What keeps the movie on track are the performances. Hall is bright and ebullient, Mame's family are strong (including Whoopi Goldberg, who also co-produced the movie) and the other supporting players are equally adept. Still, it's Deadwyler, who is exceptional here. Much of the role requires a certain internal fortitude rather than big showy emotional moments, but Deadwyler is forceful even in the quietest scenes.The dramatic climax happens even before the trial - Emmett's body is brought back to Chicago for Mame to identify. There is shock and horror, of course, but, Deadwyler also conveys the deep love she had for her son. A mother's love that even death cannot shake. Mame's resolve for the whole world to see the horrors of what happened to her child reverberates to this day. TILL may be a bit conventional, but, Deadwyler's performance and the history that Chukwu highlights give it power.\",\n",
       "  \"I can't praise enough the powerful acting of Danielle Deadwyler. She truly gives a star-making performances the mother. If the is overlooked at the Academy Awards it will be a travesty.Speaking of travesty, the murder of Emmett Till and the subsequent acquittal of the two defendants is just that. Carolyn Bryant the woman who made the accusations is in her 80s and still has never been charged with any crime. This movie vividly depicts a Southern system steeped in racism. There are scenes even in the courtroom where blacks are treated with composted distain.This is one truly fantastic movie.\",\n",
       "  \"Though certainly not a perfectly crafted film, Till is stuffed with powerhouse performances and scenes that I couldn't take my eyes off of.Danielle Deadwyler gives potentially the most engrossing, beautifully heart-wrenching performance I have beheld this year. She disappears into the role and becomes the grieving mother who was Mamie Till. She channels all of the proper emotions at all of the proper times. Sorrow, regret, compassion, hope-all of them and more are tangible in this woman as we follow her journey.What elevates the emotional core of the story even more is the impressive directing. There are impressively long takes and varied shot composition that always appear meticulously planned and crafted for the purpose of highlighting the actors and allowing them to shine, as they all deliver their dialogue with incredible sympathetic power.I usually don't rant and rave about musical scores, as I find most of them just serviceable. This one deserves recognition. The music is used surprisingly sparingly, never drowning out the human interactions. But when it's heard, it instils both melancholy and hope into the film, which is exactly what the story is ultimately about.But, like just about every biopic, Till has its issues, though the ones found here are relatively minor.For one thing, though the long takes are impressive and allow emotions to linger, they're often too long. A great deal of shots linger way longer than they need to, and scenes carry on beyond the time that their point was made. It hurts the pacing considerably.And while I did admire the script's attempt to include a great deal of real-life characters and plot points for the sake of integrity and uncomfortable honesty, it also hurts the pacing, as quite a few of them inevitably need to be rushed through with little-to-no impact on the larger picture. This is almost always a problem with biopics, which is why I think most of them should have been TV miniseries instead.Till has a great deal more depth and care put into it than I was expecting, and I applaud its ambitious reach, as it does grasp the vast majority of what it reaches for.\",\n",
       "  'Rarely does a film come along that captures and fuses feelings of outrage and heartache as effectively as \"Till does.\" Writer-director Chinonye Chukwu\\'s third feature outing breaks things wide open in her compelling take on the tragedy of African-American Chicago teenager Emmett Till, who was lynched and brutally murdered while visiting relatives in Mississippi in 1955 for whistling at a White woman. This fact-based offering vividly depicts the brutality and injustice of what happened (faint of heart viewers be warned) while simultaneously chronicling the efforts of Till\\'s courageous mother, Mamie, to protect and champion the civil rights of minorities. As one of the seminal moments in the struggle to protect those who were most vulnerable at a time when many in society were content to otherwise look the other way, this release shows how a fiercely loving and devoted mother forced the complacent to see what was really happening - and creating a grass roots groundswell for change in the process. The film gets just about everything right (save for a musical score that doesn\\'t quite seem to align with the subject matter), including in the superb period piece production values, writing that fittingly captures the mood and themes of this story, and, most notably, the performances, particularly those of Oscar contender Danielle Deadwyler, Jalyn Hall, Whoopi Goldberg and other cast members. This is a truly important film, one that genuinely lives up to all of its billing and as one of the best offerings of 2022. By all means, please see this one.',\n",
       "  \"LIKES:Fantastic Setting: If we are going back to the past, then you have to make it look like the past. This was accomplished very well with Till and helping us roll back to a part of the 1950s where so many worlds existed. We might not be in the parts that made our toes tap, our boys coming home, and sitcoms that kept us rolling in our seats. However, the movie does put us into the cultural life of a very active time and with it immerses us into the tale we are about to see. That visualization is a very important part to so much of the movie and they accomplished it beautifully with the vehicles, outfits, and buildings that they restored. Powerful stuff there.Great Use of Music/Sound Editing: Again, visual moments are a part of movies today, but the sound can be just a powerful storyteller as the visual moments they serve. Till has so much audio work to help amplify the emotions of the scene, choosing both scores and effects to add to sell the heart breaking emotion of the movie. The orchestral works play in the background to help add ambience, those gradual changes to tone constantly playing at different levels to fill the silence. Meanwhile, the musical tracks are there to bring the culture to life, but also help add some lyrics to the moment that seem to do better than the actual dialogue itself. That balance helps a lot of things sort of even out and not become a massively overwhelming movie of depression.Really Good Pace: I can't say it's perfect, but for a biopic, Till surprised me by how little I had to look at the phone to assess the time lapse. Biopics are often a bit bland and uneven at times, but this self-contained story had great direction to tell so much in such a little time. The set up was greatly done to give adequate details without dragging it out, the climactic moments had enough finesse to really make them shine, and the supporting elements all came together to be quite awesome in the long run. This part to me was perhaps one of the biggest surprises of the movie in just how well it moved.Avenues of History Building With The Main Story: Like I said above, the movie did a lot in a shorter amount of time. I felt they accomplished this balancing by helping to tag on the key moments that were building in these times, like the development of unions, the NAACP rising, and the rights they were fighting for and using them to help build this tale into. By using the moments and resorting to dialogue telling the tale, I really found that the movie managed to tell so many tales of the historical times and never swallow the story of the Tills during the segregated times of the 1950s. When you can do that and tell history through one event, using it as a lynchpin that binds it all together into a tree sitting in a forest, that's when you impress me with telling the political tale.Censorship is Just Right: This movie is going to be hard for many to watch, but fear not, there was very tasteful displays done for this movie. Till does not get lost in the domestic violence displays that drama movies have thrived on for years. No, instead they give you enough context, set up, and dialogue to paint the picture, with only a few moments of very contained shots to bring the point to life. Sure, there are going to be some moments that will still make people sick, angry, or emotional, but to handle such a tale like the Tills in such a classy way that did not dilute the impact of the movie is something I must once again nod my hat towards for great storytelling.The Acting: One of the strongest pieces of this movie is the acting and just how realistic I found the performances to be. I'll go ahead and say there is some stereotyping and extreme moments you probably expect, but it's all kept well in check and paints the picture you need it to be. Faison is fine for the little he speaks, but the man has visual acting down pat and just needed more moments to fully bring his performance out in full. Hall did well for the role Emmett, though there was more character profiling needing to be done to help further expand the performance. Yet, his ability to play well with the other members of the family displayed great skills in the Thespian arts that I look forward to seeing in the future. The star is Deadwyler though, a woman who really took the Dramatic Historical genre and ran with it. She holds control of her vocal patterns quite well, and brought so much passion to the project that it was hard for me not to get entranced into the woman's words. That fire, the delivery of her dialogue, and that crying were so well used by her, that for once I was really moved by a crying scene instead of annoyed, at least most of the time. Regardless, I was quite pleased with what was accomplished by her and the chemistry of her acting to just about every single person in this role.The Emotional Motivation: Till is a movie that is going to cause a lot of fires to be stoked on the Internet. It's a very emotional movie that will land bullseye hits on things like sadness, rage, spirituality, and motivation for justice/change. The movie sometimes does preach a bit on these moments with in your face writing, but for the majority captures the essence of this case and what it did for the historical revolutions. This tragedy really opened the gates on so many things, and feeling the rush of emotions for each act really helped me enjoy this movie more, sometimes wanting to shout out my response like one of the other audience members did. That does not happen to me a lot, and I applaud so many people for making these moments click with an audience member like me.The Monologue: Perhaps my favorite part though is this great monologue near the end of the movie. That speech is this sledgehammer that breaks the ground open and busts open the majesty of the powerful words people can say. The timing of the moment was top game. The set up and integration into the scene, near flawless as it proved to be the key point in the argument. And the delivery, acting and nuances around it all come together to be one of those famous moments that will end up on top 10 lists on YouTube. By far my favorite part of the movie, and very much a summary of the entire film into one sequence, this is something I hope many other fans enjoy like I did.DISLIKES:\\nAt Times Felt Cut/Edited Funny: This dislike is a bit picky, but at times it felt like there was more to the story to tell as Mamie sought justice for the incident. Maybe there was more adventure to see in Mississippi, or perhaps there were more memories to draw on to help further deepen the relationship. Maybe there were more moments of interacting with other characters, or perhaps a little more the antagonists viewpoints that they wanted to explore. I don't know the answer, but things felt at times a bit more edited and lacking, which for the movie like this, I would have welcomed to get a little more of the picture of the Till story.Wanted More of the Case Preparation To Help Add that Movie Magic: When you start doing cases and building up evidence for a very hot topic like this one in the decades, I hope that movie magic comes into play to amp up the drama. Till takes a more realistic approach, or perhaps cutting the movie like they did gave that illusion. Either way, the movie could have used more case build up magic that I've seen in other Crime series/movies. I can't tell you how or what cliches they could have done, but I can say that little regulation of flavor might have upped the game a little more for me. When adding those moments in and giving you more of that suspense and strategy, you help make one of the biggest moments of the movie shine even greater. Yet at 2 hours and ten minutes, that could really have dragged things out.A Little More Other Character Involvement, primarily Whoopi: My biggest dislike, the character moments felt a little underutilized at times. Don't get me wrong, many characters did great, had purpose, and were memorable, but there are again things that feel a little cheated out in the grand design. There seemed to be more to the story of Mamie, with so many people helping her that I had expected much more engagement than what we got sometimes. This was true for the legendary Goldberg, who though did great with her limited dialogue, had more to give in the grand scheme of things. Had this been fleshed out more, we could certainly get a longer movie, and perhaps overshadow the emotion I talked about earlier. However, adding a little bit more at times would not have hurt if done as strategically as so many other movies have done.The VERDICT:Till is a powerhouse of emotional drama that utilizes so many things well to really make the tale come to life. The actors in this movie are certainly much of the thanks for bringing so much fire to this movie, dominating the screen with performances certainly worthy of awards. However, the writing, directing, and visual elements certainly have much to do with the experience being maximized to drive the emotion even further. Things come together very well in this movie, and I was very pleased with so much they balanced in the short amount of time they did it in. It was smart writing, with very big respect and that to me is tough to accomplish in this day and age. Certainly there are more things that could use time to polish out. Character development and cutting certainly are two of the bigger things to smooth out, and adding some movie magic to the court case would have been nice too. Yet, the movie makes these moments seem trivial, when you see the movie as a whole and I again enjoyed this film so well.My scores are:\\nDrama: 8.5-9.0\\nMovie Overall 8.0.\",\n",
       "  '\"TILL\" was powerfully and extraordinarily done in terms of actors, accuracy, and such. The movie captures reasonably accurately and precisely what occurred, and does an honorable job of capturing and conveyed this horrific episode in history. What happened to Emmitt Till in 1955 in Mississippi has haunted me for years and years... It was and is very important to make this very well known to persons across the country and the world, including in the form of this greatly-done movie. (There were a couple of detailed things I had not known, such as the touching fact that Emmett gave his Mom his wrist-watch before getting on the train.)As careful research of facts has revealed, the initial horror is then added to by that cashier-female person\\'s total manufacturing of lies about what Emmitt really did and said in the store. What we do know is that he \\'whistled\\' at her outside the store. Maybe while alive that shop-girl person will publicly tell the truth about what Did and what Did Not happen. She owes that to the family, the nation, and the world at large.And then the so-called \"jury\" renders a not-guilty verdict. Horror is added to horrors again and again over time as the murderers openly admit their crimes AND GET PAID FOR DOING SO!Some of the other offenses are left out in interest of time and pacing, such as how, after Emmitt\\'s brutal torture and murder, Emmitt\\'s Dad\\'s military record was grossly misrepresented by the southern Caucasian crowd in order to undermine what was done to Emmitt Till.The way African Americans were (to some extent still are?) referred to and regarded in \"Mississippi,\" and how such courageous and gracious people are referred to with name-calling and such was and is stingingly horrific. -- in 1955 it was, and still is done by small tiny-minded persons who were bred, fed, and indoctrinator in these prejudiced ways and mind-sets. (This poisonous \\'treatment of\\' and name-calling of Black fellow human beings is part of the reason for 9 stars instead of 10, even though it was historically accurate -- I just couldn\\'t stand it or abide it.)One of the most profound and powerful statements in the whole film was the quote of what Emmitt Till\\'s Mom so aptly said: \"WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ANY OF US, ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD, HAD BETTER BE THE BUSINESS OF US ALL.\" - Emmett Till\\'s Mother, Mamie - her revelation after the incident and trial.',\n",
       "  \"Till (2022) is a movie my wife and I saw in theatres last night. The storyline follows a mother in the mid 1950s who lives with her son after her husband passed away in World War II. She is originally from Mississippi and believes it's important for her son to spend time with family and learn where he came from. She warns him things are different in the south before he goes but a few remarks to the wrong person after he gets there, and the boy ends up missing and eventually brutally murdered. The story follows how the mother manages the loss of her son and seeks justice....This movie is directed by Chinonye Chukwu (Clemency) and stars Danielle Deadwyler (The Harder they Fall), Frankie Faison (Coming to America), Whoopi Goldberg (Sister Act), Haley Bennett (Swallow) and Jalyn Hall (Space Jam: A New Legacy).The depiction of the settings and era was perfect. The attire Deadwyler wore the entire picture was stunning as was the cinematography and use of lighting. The performances are very strong across the cast. The storyline really focuses on the main character and how a mother has to deal with these types of incidents and manage them both on a micro and macro level. It was impressive how the story follows her journey. The premise of the storyline didn't add much new outside of those elements; however, the delivery of the strengths of Mamie was impressive. Her interactions with every character were interesting, unpredictable and worthwhile. You didn't know if she was going to be mad, sad, breakdown or composed.Overall, this is a solid period piece with a worthwhile storyline about the legendary Mamie Till-Mobley. I would score this a solid 8/10 and strongly recommend it.\",\n",
       "  \"I had been fascinated by the Emmett Till story having watched several documentaries so I was excited when this movie was announced.In a movie year where there was up to this point one film I found truly exceptional which was Top Gun Maverick, I was concerned that with the track record of bad films this movie may not serve its story justice.While Maverick may be the most entertaining movie I have seen this year so far, artistically Till is the best film. The Academy must recognize all involved at Oscar time. Danielle Dayweather must get Best Actress and the movie needs to be nominated for Best Picture. Yes it's that good.As some other reviews have stated this is a straightforward biopic. Naturally if you know the real story everything will be predictable.But that doesnt matter because the story is told so magnificently with great writing, direction, superb acting and set design.I have a feeling this may not light fire at the box office which is a shame because this movie represents a very important part of history. Even with a PG-13 rating it is a fairly intense film, but this was also a very intense part of history.Some audiences may find it too unsettling and disturbing but it is supposed to be so, but we also can learn about how to stand up for those who need it and to pay attention more closely to issues in our nation that need attention and to do something about them.I dont want to say too much more and possibly give away more details but if you are thinking of seeing junk this fall season like Halloween Ends skip it and go see a truly great movie one that may not be equaled for some time.Congratulations to all involved in this wonderful film and let's hope you are all remembered at Oscar time.\",\n",
       "  \"This is a great movie, great acting and directing!! I'm always watching any documentary or series about Emmit Till but this movie did Justice to him!! Danielle who played Mami did a really good job!! She deserves an Oscar for that role!! I know many are skeptical about seeing this but the world needs to continue to know what those animals did to that poor little boy!! It's so good I'm going to see it again real soon!! Make sure you teach your children about this story and take them to he see it as well!! I'm already waiting for the digital release to come out!! The kid that played Till did a good job too!!!\"],\n",
       " [\"Likes:Cute: If you have seen the trailers, you want be surprised that this movie is adorable on so many levels. Lyle's journey starts out very charming, the cute little baby croc being like a child version of the Geico Gecko, and then quickly blooming into that tragic and loveable hero. The movie feels much like a kids' book come to life and both live and animate characters being these loveable representations of family values. The antics are fun, the lighthearted nature of the movie just puts a loveable quality to it, and the positivity takes away just about every scary element of the world. All in all it's fun.Decent Pace For First Part of the Film: The pacing of the film works so well for me at the start. It's not a prolonged banter and trek through the muck of how rough life can be. No, Lyle gets right into the theatrics, having fun and getting the good vibes started as the animate crocodile and his new friend start their journey to a new life. Sure it takes some of the sting and character development out, but in doing so, it respects the time and fun to give you and your kids the wow factor they want.The Acting: It's not bad at all for me in this film. Lyle's cast is impressive, and though they are in a children film, the performances aren't pulled like some other younger films do. Constance Wu is the best for me in this film, a bit kid focused, but then recovering to be the same fiery spirit that the woman always brings, balanced with the care she shows too. A toned down version of Crazy Rich Asians to give you an example. Then comes Javier Bardem, the man is fun and certainly in a place I have not seen, but gives the role enthusiasm, splendor, and more details despite not being his usual element. Scoot McNairy is fine as Mr. Primm, and once the movie actually starts picking things up, the character gets better than when he first starts, more interesting and dynamic when he starts integrating with the rest of the family. Special shout out to Winslow Fegley because the star of the show with Lyle deserves recognition for the stellar performance he put on as the kid struggling to find friends and seek out kindness. The chemistry around the team is very good, and they form that odd family they were going for in this film.The Humor: Certainly geared to a much younger audience, Lyle is golden for the fun and lighthearted jokes that I think you could expect this movie to have. I chuckled a lot at the timing of many jokes, especially involving the cat, as they worked with the real life cast. Sure, this is going to be much more tuned to the 4-11 year old range if I'm honest, but the humor is very fitting for the film without being so juvenile that adults will be bored to death. That's a plus in my book.The Heart and Soul Of the Movie: Beneath all the fun though is the heart and soul of what the movie wants. Lyle's books may be a tribute to Nick Jr. Like tales, but the movie was adapted to be something more and it really worked for me in the grand scheme of things. Lyle's movie has about three big lessons to take away from in my book, but they all work organically, and are presented well for much of the film. There is character development with inspirational shots and moments, and they don't go too preachy for much of the film given what they could have done instead. As the film continues to expand further, and the plot progresses, the film had my heart as the final numbers happened. I found some relevance which helps, but overall the movie has a lot of soul and quality that I absolutely love in my films.The Musical Numbers: By far, the biggest bang of the movie are the song and dance numbers. Like a kid version of the Greatest Showman, Lyle has props for the song department. Covers are fun and tuned to the scene, giving Mendes his chance to really make his move on some classic songs that are fun. However, the original numbers and songs, though repetitive, really have that fire I like and give you the spirit of the show business, without the circus as a medium. They were creative with the numbers, the energy exciting and fun, with some creativity to the stage they performed in. I see many a child enjoying this, and theater loving child at heart enjoying it even more. Mendes carries a lot of weight on his shoulder, and the pop nature of the movie really drives the bus to the magical art of the theater. I think this will be a big winner for the movie and certainly worth a trip to theater.DISLIKES:The Plot has Holes: One of my biggest things I did not like, was the gaping holes and shortcuts of the movie. Lyles journey has a lot of heart, and cuteness, but the movie takes major leaps in the timeline with the story which was glaringly obvious for me. I cringed at how fast things progressed, and how so many other character arcs were sort of smoothed over to fit another song into the mix. Don't get me wrong, your kids won't care and the movie is still fun, but there was more that could have been done to make the story much more integrated and natural to make the full tale come to life.Misuse of Characters: There are two or three characters in the film who had props to be another part of the story. Perhaps it's going to be in a sequel, but these characters are the story arcs that feel very misused and skipped on when it came to the tale. The African American girl in particularly held a lot of props, but she was directed towards some key moments that left me feeling cheated of another fun element and interactions. Again, when you see the big animate crocodile and the fun he is having, most are not going to care, but as a reviewer there was much more for the film to give if they had just taken time and maybe one less reprise of the first song.The Ending Is a Bit Rushed: A lot of things happen in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, and though you get plenty of details for the experience, I can't say that the movie accomplished the best conclusion to the tale. Lyle's journey needed a little more organization, a little more flair and planning, a little more edge in the kid fashion, and of course more time. So many things felt too convenient and jammed in, that the last ten minutes or so felt like an afterthought that put a nice bow on the movie. Will it accomplish the task at hand? Sure, it almost always does and paves the way for something more to come. However, the movie needs a bit more polish to reach the full potential for the ending.The Animation At Times: Again, the studio can do a lot more than I can with their talent and resources, and I really did find the animation adorable and moving with ease. However, the movie is pulling some punches compared to other feats of CGI technology and does not quite look as real as some might want it to. The cat named Loretta is a prime example of this, looking a tad too CGI, and Lyle at times gets a bit too cartoony given again what other films have done. The worst is when other crocodiles show up. They are consistent, but you tend to notice the limitations when they are trying to make the other animals have a more realistic touch. It's nitpicky I know, and truth be told, the style holds a bit of the spirt and fun of the movie with it, but that doesn't meant eh animation is not something that can get touched up on.The VERDICT:To be honest, I had a lot of fun with the movie and found the crocodile's story to be one fo the most touching films of the year. Lyle and his crew will really drive into the hearts of the young and young at heart, and give you a cute adventure that feels out of a picture book. With some great relevance to me, the movie touches some great life lessons in a deep manner, and tends to shy away from the in your face moments, which is a plus for me. And of course the songs are fantastic in bringing life to the screen and really providing the break from reality this film is meant to do. True, the story needs work, the planning and time constraints really feeling present to me with several character and story arcs that were frustrating to witness. And ti's true that the movie needed some more timing components when it came to the ending. But I feel this movie is a great night out at the theater, especially for a family fun night, or at least a view at home. With this, my scores for Lyle's adventure are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0\\nMovie Overall: 7.0.\",\n",
       "  \"All I can say is that I like it. I was expecting it to be dull going in, but I found myself entertained. It does not hurt that Lyle Lyle the Crocodile was a childhood favorite of mine (Well...favorite might be too much. I'm giving a lot of credit to it simply because it's a book I actually read).I can see why Javier Bardem did it. He got to change it up a little bit and show us a humorous side we rarely get to see in the type of movies he's best known for.As a musical it sucks, but I'm bias cause that's not my thing but this did not stop me from liking it, overall.Definitely glad I took the time to see it.\",\n",
       "  \"Well, color me surprised. I actually had a pretty good time with this lightweight musical romp.This is a thoroughly well-directed movie, which was shocking to me. There is quite a bit of thoughtful camera placement that visually emphasises how the characters are feeling about the events that unfold around them.Musical numbers are a surprisingly difficult thing to get right, and I thought this movie managed to pull off some pretty spectacular ones. There is a great deal of variety to the visual presentation of each musical sequence, with characters and camera moving around with some fun choreography.I could tell that these filmmakers were really trying to make this movie as good as it could be. Their effort shows and mostly pays off.As for plot, it's very narratively slight; it's full of contrivances and forced conflicts that never once felt substantial or surprising or meaningful. Because of this, I'll probably be forgetting about this movie very quickly.There's also a sequence in which a montage is shown made up of scenes from earlier in the movie, and I thought it was hilariously clumsy in how it was put together.But still, I thought this was an unabashedly sweet, charming, and pleasantly competent little musical adventure. It'll be good for the family.\",\n",
       "  \"Sure it is made for modern times and today but no denying kids and kids at heart like yours truly will find this endearing there.Javier Bardem cast against type as showman Hector P Valenti and sees a singing crocodile who only communicates through that, but is smart and wise named Lyle. Lyle is lovable despite being a crocodile but gets stage freight when he has to be in public.When Valenti leaves to earn money and leaves Lyle there, eighteen months later, the Primm family that has math professor Mr. Primm, cook Mrs. Primm and young son Josh who suffers from Asthma there.Get a very rude awakening from cranky neighbor Mr. Grumps and Loretta the cat. As Grumps finds no redemption like in the books and that he is one that needed throughout the movie to be put in his place.Making it very hard for the Primm family but focuses more on Josh a two-dimensional character in the books and his relationship with the lovable crocodile there. As people need to not make assumptions there.As Josh struggles to make new friends but finds one in Lyle and he and his parents and Hector who has returned but still struggling due to Lyle's stage freight there, as they make the usually money and publicity hungry Hector into a big sympathetic but sometimes, having a stage freight crocodile leaves him little to no choice there.But the family warms up to Lyle and tries to find ways to deal with their nemesis and cranky Mr. Grumps who only cares about his cat Loretta. As Loretta is also sick of her so called owner.Great for the whole entire family except for one or two very quick scenes. No cursing hardly in it.\",\n",
       "  \"Honestly, this was the cute movie I have watched after the most recent tom and jerry. Cute crocodile with an amazing Shawn Mendes voiceover/song over. Every character in the movie gave their peak performance. I saw lots of little kids enjoying the movie, they were dancing near the screen when they croc sings. Worth watching if you have kids below 3 years old. It's a complete and clean movie without any obscene. There are a few scenes, where you feel aww and a few scenes you feel sad. I am an adult, I still love these movies. I saw many families enjoying the movie with their little kids. Perfect family-watchable movie for Thanksgiving weekend. Don't watch it as a movie but watch it to enjoy yourself with your family.\",\n",
       "  'Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is a fabulous musical film about overcoming your fears, to accept something new while pushing the traditional boundaries of what we call family.The storyline follows a boy, Josh (Winslow Fegley), moving to New York City with his parents and being uncomfortable with new challenges like an unfamiliar home, crowded New York City and meeting new friends at a new school. Josh is a kind soul, but he\\'s frequently afraid and lacks confidence. However he had no idea how much his life would change in a matter of days after his family\\'s move to the new city.This movie is funny; the music is contagious; and the love and care of one another is beautiful. The special effects and scenes of the film are incredible! What I love about the film is how Lyle the Crocodile (Shawn Mendes), with his special talent changes the lives of the main characters in the film. It starts with Hector (Javier Barden), a struggling showman who never gives up on Lyle\\'s talent or his own and, after some bumps, learns the importance of friendship and family. Josh and Lyle become friends in a very awkward way and from then on never want to be separated from each other. Josh\\'s Mom (Constance Wu) and Dad (Scoot McNairy) can\\'t believe their eyes when they see Lyle for the first time, and their hearts open wide for the big creature. My favorite scene is when Josh and Lyle sing, without any fear, to the whole city. The trust between them is honest and cute. As in almost every film, a bad guy (and his pet) are around. In this case, Mr. Grumps (Brett Gelman) - a very not fun and unhappy neighbor and his cat, Loretta, who almost destroy the show of a lifetime and a beautiful family. You must see it!The message of Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile is \"Trust and believe your family and closest friends; they are always looking out for you and your success.\"I give Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18, plus adults. By Keila V., KIDS FIRST!',\n",
       "  \"I rated this movie high not because it is the best movie ever with the best plot, script, & actors, but because it was not stuffed full of adult agendas & adult situations being pushed on children. There weren't kids or animals cussing, or being bleeped, there wasn't unecessary sexual or same sex content, & it wasn't chock full of political or other social issues. It was just a cute, fun, entertaining movie I could enjoy with my 10 year old. I can recommend it to my teacher friends to stream in classrooms without worry when it is released. Thank you!The only qualm I can think of is Lyle's singing voice. I didn't feel that it quite fit the crocodile.\",\n",
       "  'Sure it\\'s an offbeat premise and sure the plot lines are predictable, but sometimes you just want something entertaining to help forget the woes of the world. While it is certainly aimed at a younger audience, this 64-year old found the movie to be entertaining and very enjoyable - not to mention memorable (the music will live in your head for a while much like \"The Greatest Showman\" - same music writing team). As for the rest of our \"review crew\", our 7-year old and his class buddy loved it, our 12-year old liked it very much, while our 15-year old (who also loved \"The Greatest Showman\") wants to buy the soundtrack and the movie when it is released on DVD (yes, I firmly believe in physical purchases and not the ethereal streaming). My bride liked it too, so a solid \"thumbs up\" from us!',\n",
       "  'Lyle is an absolutely adorable character. And Javier Bardem and Constance Wu deliver excellent performances. All in all, it was a moderately enjoyable affair.What kept Lyle from reaching its potential were the story, the pacing and the songs. The story lacks an antagonist, a threat, some kind of objective that looms large. And that absence is felt, with multiple moments begging the question \"wonderful characters, but what is this all about ultimately?\".The pacing was a little off, with really exciting moments followed by long, trudging luls. While everyone was so very incredibly charming, the movie did feel boring at times.Finally, the missed opportunity is the songs. They\\'re simply not iconic. I still remember songs from Frozen, Moana, Encanto and others, but I\\'m confident that I won\\'t remember any of the tunes from Lyle.This may not read like a particularly flattering review and that\\'s not my intention. I though Lyle was nice, but not particularly so. I might just be spoiled by what seems like so many other exceptionally good animation films these past few years.',\n",
       "  'Finally! A kid\\'s movie that\\'s heartwarming, family friendly, and isn\\'t overly self-indulgent.Javier Bardem was stunning. Lyle was animated extremely well; cartoonish, but still believable and very expressive.This movie does a great job of showing representation without being \"preachy\" about it. There is a Spanish character, a Taiwanese character, black characters, and they even do a great job of representing blended families.The movie takes liberties with the source material, the book \"Lyle Lyle Crocodile\". Even still the changes make sense for the on-screen adaptation. They even make a nod to the idea that one of the characters in the movie was likely responsible for the publication of the book; a nice touch.My 8 year old daughter loved the movie, my wife loved the movie, and I loved the movie. A great story about loving each other despite our circumstances and finding courage in trying times.I absolutely recommend this to any and all looking for a movie about a touching and loveable singing crocodile.',\n",
       "  \"I didn't realize the bulk of it is a musical which I really am not a fan of but I really liked this for what it is. Quite heartwarming, adorable, full of delightfulness, and great for the family! I love Prim family and Lyle was spot on throughout. The directors are great for feel good movies I really like one of their other films Office Christmas Party, nice to see something more innocent! Javier Bardem is basically David Copperfield character that's kind of perfect joke he's solid though. All the bonding with Lyle is the best aspects, for someone that doesn't like singing in movies this is one of the best ones that I would recommend.\",\n",
       "  \"I saw Lyle Lyle Crocodile, starring Javier Bardem-Being the Ricardos, Skyfall; Constance Wu-Fresh Off the Boat_tv, Eastsiders_tv; Winslow Fegley-8_Bit Christmas, Come Play and the voice of Shawn Mendes-Hollymation_tv, The 100_tv.This is a family friendly movie that is based on a children's book from 1965. Javier plays a down on his luck entertainer-magician, singer, whatever is needed etc,-that comes across a singing crocodile, voiced by Shawn. He decides to put Shawn in his act and go on the road and make millions with him but there is a problem. Shawn has stage fright and freezes on stage the first night. Javier decides to go on the road by himself and leaves Shawn in the attic of his house and tells him that he will be back soon. Well, it's not soon and a new family move into the house. Constance is the mother and Winslow is her son. Winslow discovers Shawn-of course-and becomes friends with him but Shawn has to hide from any prying eyes. The only way Shawn can communicate is by singing-he doesn't just talk-so all his songs fit into the narrative of the story. There is a nosy and grumpy neighbor that keeps trying to stir up trouble, too.It's rated PG for some mild peril and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be a good rental for the whole family to watch.\",\n",
       "  \"I'm in my mid-20s and I like Shawn Mendes' voice as Lyle. Having him in the film made it good to watch, but I thought it's plot could have been better. Some of the characters are not emphasized as much as I thought they would be and some of the music is a bit basic. Also, the conflict in the movie was not as climactic as I thought it was going to be in my opinion. Nevertheless, I do not think that watching the film was a total waste of time or money. It's important to keep in mind that this is a musical for kids and therefore the plot is going to be somewhat basic. If you're a Shawn Mendes fan and/or a parent who wants to take his/her kid to see a movie, it's worth a watch.\",\n",
       "  \"It felt like it took a while to get going, I have to admit I don't know what I think about the casting, I didn't think the magician had a particularly good voice, then as for the croc, I didn't love his voice, like JLM who does so many perfectly I felt that mendes's voice was a bit whiny in places.It was a peculiar decision to have him as a mute, why not sing some dialogue to just make him more endearing? As with it being a croc it didn't instantly have the warm aww feeling you get with most characters.The acting was fine, cheesy family fun, nothing was bad, but equally nothing was particularly memorable, I don't think it has much of a rewatch value and the songs sadly weren't particularly memorable or impressive. I mean from showman to vivo I do love animated song music for feel good playlists but none here really caught my ear.It's a decent fun watch. It's a good movie, not all will be spectacular but it's definitely one kids will love, I'm unsure it has sequel potential but I guess the owner could be a baddy and take him on your etc.Doesn't seem particularly popular sadly, guy at the cinema says it's one of the worst supported kids film this year, even ones like the excellent Ron's gone wrong was bringing in more people.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a kid's movie and my adult brain doesn't allow me to reason with why there is a talking crocodile living with people in a house (do I lack imagination). Having said that, I enjoyed it. My child (aged 5) enjoyed it. It was pleasant, heartwarming. I would recommend going to see it. Don't be fooled by The Greatest Showman writers producing the songs, it's unfortunately not a patch on that soundtrack.I thought the actors all did really well. I don't think Mendes's voice matched the crocodile though. I'm not sure why. He's a great singer though and nice to listen to.A few plot holes but with a singing crocodile there's bound to be.\",\n",
       "  'What\\'s not to love about this film? Pure fun and great entertainment. Lots of unexpected twists and turns, and great acting. Winslow. Fegley is a refreshing new face in the world of cinema, and Constance Wu is wonderful as his worried mother. But whenever Javier Barden\\'s in a scene, he explodes with life and energizes the entire story. Who knew he was a triple threat - dancing, singing, while portraying a great lovable rascal in this movie? This is as as good as The Greatest Showman, with the addition of a singing, dancing, but otherwise shy crocodile whose love language is. . . Food! If you missed this on the big screen, you missed seeing a classic in the making. I don\\'t understand why the Box Office is so low, even though the film\\'s been out for three weeks, as I write this. All I can guess is that Sony didn\\'t market t as well as they should, so most folks thought, \"Well, I\\'ve read the book, so why see the movie? WRONG!\" Do yourself a favor and watch this film with people you love. It will leave you feeling free and wonderful. And make you want to celebrate for the rest of the day. How I wish there were more films like this one to revel in!',\n",
       "  \"SCORE: 6.7/10That was cute. Very cheesy, but cute. And yes, bonus points for the beatboxing snake. I feel like this movie really struggled with its identity and what it was trying to portray to the audience, which made at lot of it not hit well. The pacing was super fast, which is great for a feel good movie, but they added elements to try and make the audience emotionally invested in the relationships between characters that just weren't there. Hector really wasn't a villain and a lot of the relationship between Lyle and the Primm's was overshadowed by the cheesy nature of the humor and story line. It felt goofy, not emotional. Javier Bardem was incredible and his scenes were all super impactful, but I wish we had gotten to see more of him. Brett Gelman is also a gem, but it felt like he switched back and forth between actual villain and comic relief character. The music was great, as expected, and Lyle was an awesome character from beginning to end. Constance Wu's musical number with Lyle was highly entertaining and of course Shawn Mendes killed it. This movie definitely had its moments, but it was almost impossible to take it seriously during the serious moments.\",\n",
       "  'With a strong message at its core and a likable cast of characters, \"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\" is great, family fun. The story starts a bit slow, but once the music begins everything changes. Just like in \"The Greatest Showman\", \"Dear Evan Hansen\" and \"Trolls\", Pasek and Paul show their skills with the music in this film. Each song adds depth to the story and elevates the otherwise slow-paced script.The casting is excellent with Shawn Mendes stealing the show. His voice is incredible and hilariously fits the adolescent crocodile. My kids were itching to dance the whole time and energetically cheered Lyle on. Having read the \"Lyle the Crocodile\" series, including the prequel \"The House on East 88th Street\" as a kid, it was a joy to see my kids appreciate the same stories.First and foremost, this is a movie made for children. Is this a negative? Not at all, there are plenty of children\\'s movies that have excellent cinematic value. Although it is cute, \"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\" is not one of those movies. The film is full of cliches, the characters act more like caricatures than real people and the story is paper thin.There are four new songs by Pasek and Paul in this movie, and that is not enough. All four songs are going to be on repeat in my car for weeks, but I wish there were more (for context, \"The Greatest Showman\" had 9 original songs). While the music is great, the plot in between songs was rudimentary and a little awkward.\"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile\" is exactly what you would expect after looking at the poster. The movie is full of pigeonholed characters and childish situations that occasionally find their footing. The soundtrack is excellent, and Shawn Mendes sings his heart out, though the rest of the movie falls a little flat. My best cinematic comparison would be \"Stuart Little\" with pop music. It\\'s a wholesome movie that the entire family, especially those with little kids, will enjoy.Best Character: Lyle\\nBest Scene: Mrs. Primm drawing Lyle\\nBest Quote: The whole Rip up the Recipe song.',\n",

Lyle was sweet and tender despite not talking except when singing with the voice of Shawn Mendes. Lyle's expressions were charming and expressive (grate animation). Javier Bardem was great, as always. Fun and touching musical numbers; please don't forget to take tissues with you as it has moments that will make you tear up a bit. Please, go to the theater and see it on the big screen, take your children they will love it as much as I did! I would love to see it again.\",\n",

Lyle & Loretta are super cute, the music is fantastic, and the movie is absolutely sweet. No guns, scary monsters, horrific cruel people or super fast flashes needed, only a story about friendship, love and family with real human beings (not superheroes) -and with a lovely singing crocodile that children & parents will adore. 10/10.',\n",

       "  \"Josh Gordon directed a pleasant movie Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile set in NYC. The movie is based on book series by Bernard Waber. Lyle a crocodile (voiced by Shawn Mendes) is the main character. Lyle has emotions and responds very well to affection, selflessness, acts of kindness, love filled words and music. Hector Valenti (talented Javier Bardem from Vicki Christina Barcelona and No country for old men) is kind and loves Lyle but also has selfish motive of making a lot of money with his own magician abilities and singing Lyle. But Lyle sees through Hector's selfishness and freezes in front of audience. Then comes the Primm family. Mrs Primm (Constance Wu from Crazy Rich Asians and Hustlers) author of cookbooks, her husband (Scoot McNairy from Luckiest girl in the world, Argo) with a new teaching job in NYC school and their son Josh (Winslow Fegley) move into Hector's townhouse without realizing Hector left Lyle in the attic with a note. The friendship between Lyle and Josh, only child and lonely boy, is full of niceness, true affection and fun enjoyable pastimes. Mrs Primm warms up to Lyle and has fun happy days filled with songs and happiness. Lyle eventually makes friends with Mr Primm and wins him over. Primm family and Lyle become inseparables. Hector learns his lesson just from watching Primms . True love just needs true understanding. Shawn Mendes voice is a huge plus point for the movie.Saw some great horror movies in 2022 :Smile, X, Pearl ...\\nAnd now a very different movie.... Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile ...very pleasant 106 minutes. Very enjoyable.\",\n",
       "  \"I read a few of the reviews most of them being positive and some negative. So I was a little nervous to watch however I actually enjoyed the movie, the songs were really good I love Shawn Mendes so I enjoyed a little more. The acting was good as well. It was pretty cool seeing Murray from Stranger Things. Though it was a good movie there were some aspects of the story that were confusing. I heard it was based off a book so I'm not sure how accurate it is but parts of the story didn't make sense. For example Lyle can sing but why can't he talk, he can only sing? I'm not sure what or how that works. I also wished that Shawn had a speaking role because he's a good actor so it would've been cool to hear him talk. Otherwise It it was really good I definitely recommend it! I'd rate it an 8/10.\",\n",
       "  \"I ran to restroom knowing full well I may miss beginning of movie but I was okay with that. My expectations for this movie were low, very low. I made it back quickly in time to see the last couple of previews then the movie started. It took a few minutes but slowly Javier Bardem started to sing and dance and I thought, 'Wow! He's really good!' Then the singing and comedy commenced. I even looked over at the hubby expecting him to be nodding off or checking his NFL bets but he was also fully onboard. Watching my 8 yr old daughter crack up as I cracked up at the same scenes was a great experience I won't forget anytime soon. We were thoroughly entertained with this movie. The music was G-R-E-A-T! Loved the throwbacks! Buying the soundtrack right now. Will definitely buy the movie 💯💝\",\n",

The opening number is really pretty good. Think gene kelly. As usual javier looks like a troll. The worse he looks, the better he seems to like it. Why he chooses to hide his aura under a basket is odd. Which brings us to this movie. A hack vaudevillian with a singing and dancing crocodile has a hard time making it in show business due to the fact that the croc gets stage fright. Its complicated but the croc finds a little boy for a buddy and they have adventures in nyc. There are clueless parents and of course an evil downstairs neighbor. The movie lacks spark. It not very good and i'm not sure how kids will find all of this. By the way, where is west times square? Just asking.\"],\n",

At the beginning of the movie folks were whooping and cheering but by the end everyone just kind of walked out like it was any other movie. Still a good number of gory kills but something always felt off or was missing. Also the mom's horrible acting lol. Thanks for the memories hope there is a third and it gets the feel of the original back!Why does this app require 600 characters now, it must be because the $1billion dollar show got hammered so now they make it hard to write reviews. Regardless I'll just keep rambling until I hit the limit. Man still 100 more this is crazy. Hopefully they lower this because this is too much to write.\",\n",
       "  \"There is so much more gore in this film compared to the first & very graphic shots which was exactly what I was expecting so that part was fine.. the actors in this one are also so much better which is nice but for a slasher film not essential... however the run time of this film was excessive & the overall plot which seemed to be heading one way but didn't really answer anything was a head scratcher! Felt like there was a lot of potential & pieces in place for a really great film but the execution was off. Lauren LaVera as Sienna was really brilliant in this, a truly fantastic performance. I'd recommend watching this but know it's more about straight up gore with supernatural themes than any real storyline!\",\n",
       "  \"After Terrifier, Art the clown fans demanded more, and more is certainly what writer/director Damien Leone has given us with Terrifier 2: his film clocks in at a weighty 140 minutes and is packed to the brim with gory mayhem. This mammoth runtime is a little problematic, the final act feeling very drawn out (more about that later), but for those who enjoy their splatter with deliciously dark humour, the film is, for the most part, very entertaining.This time around, Art (David Howard Thornton) targets teenage girl Sienna (Lauren LaVera) and her family and friends, who are gearing up for Halloween festivities. With his trademark finger waves, cheeky grin and lifting of his teeny tiny hat, Art is a superb horror maniac, both hilarious (his silent reactions to his kills are priceless) and horrific, the clown making a real mess of his victims. The practical special effects are top notch and quite nauseating at times, easily topping what we have seen before.Where the film does fall down is with the lore that Leone introduces for his killer: it's all a bit confusing and makes the final act less effective. Somehow, Sienna's dead artist father was linked to Art, drawing pictures of the clown and his victims in his sketchbook. Sienna's father also gave her a sword before he died, which turns out to have magical properties that the plot doesn't explain very well (or at all). Furthermore, Art has a sidekick, a little girl, one of his previous victims who is now demonic. The finale in which Sienna becomes a super bad-ass warrior wielding her magic blade to give Art a bit of his own medicine, is both baffling and over-long.Then, just when you think it's all over, there's a post credits scene that is just as confusing.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for the insanely gory killings -- If Leone had been able to make the supernatural stuff work better, and perhaps shaved 20 minutes off the runtime, my rating would have been a few points higher.\",\n",
       "  \"That was way too long. It got to the point where enough was enough. After about an hour I couldn't wait for it to end. Art The Clown looks great and there's some gnarly kill scenes, but that's literally it. The acting's terrible and there's almost zero storyline. All this film consists of is a killer clown running around slaughtering people. Why people are so into these films is beyond me. Don't get me wrong! I enjoy horror films just as much as the next guy, but some of these kill scenes are extremely overdone. You gotta be somewhat sadistic to be into this stuff. When it was all said and done it's just an all around cheesy film. 5 stars.\",\n",
       "  \"Terrifier 2 is insanely gory. The kills in Terrifier 2 are absolutely nuts. The pain Art inflicts on his many victims competes with some of the most grotesque fatalities in Mortal Kombat and then some. The makeup effects are absolutely top-notch. If the kills and makeup are what you're looking for you will absolutely not be disappointed in that regard.Art the clown is awesome as well. The way David Howard Thornton switches between darkly humorous to murderous rage without saying a word solidifies him as one of the top slasher villain's. I loved Thornton's performance in Terrifier 2.The old-school aesthetic/cinematography really gives the Terrifier 2 an awesome Grindhouse feel to the movie.Terrifier 2 is INCREDIBLY long for a slasher movie and will probably be the most common complaint people have after watching it. Many scenes could have either been trimmed down or completely cut altogether, Especially in the first act. The pacing is horrendous and the bloated length comes off as pretentious. Also, the mom in Terrifier 2 drove me nuts every scene she was in. Thankfully the performances are better this time around, some more campier than others but an improvement none the less. Lauren LaVera kicked butt as the final girl.Be sure to stay after the credits as well. A few audiences members prematurely left once the credits started to roll and missed out on a comically grotesque sequence.\",\n",
       "  \"This film is 40-50 minutes too long.It all gets too repetitive. One gruesome killing after another with a lack of inventiveness.The main protagonist acts her part very well, but sadly the direction lets her down.Art is as menacing as he was in his first outing in 'The 9th Circle', but you have to wonder just how far the character can be taken. In my opinion, this is it. This simply cannot be allowed to turn into another 'Halloween' type franchise carrying on 20+ years beyond its best.I was beginning to think this was a Peter Jackson film, as i never saw an end to it in sight. The last 30 minutes or so were torturous, and not in the way they intended it to be. Art used up his 9 lives well before the end credits eventually rolled.Some of the killings were far too drawn out. The friend who was scalped being a prime example. Now, i realise this is a film, but in the real world that poor lassie would've died of shock. As it was, we see her having her eyeball sliced open, then she's scalped, then her back is sliced and diced, her arm is broken, and snapped off at the elbow(now surely by that point shock would've taken over and she'd be dead), her remaining hand is split in two and then she's then stabbed repeatedly and left for dead, but NO. She somehow manages to drag herself along the floor towards her phone. Art returns, pour bleach on her, then rubs salt into her gaping wounds, and rips her face off... Surely that's her dead now??NO. She reacts when her Mother walks in on Art now slicing and dicing what's left of her body.This whole scene takes up around five minutes, and is typical of the film. Everything is drawn out needlessly.The first film was OK, it wasn't great by any means, this one is far too self-indulgent on behalf of the director. Drop the ego, make a 80 minute film which gets to the point, and move on.\",\n",
       "  \"Terrified not at all . This is shock gore film. Not scary but gory . There is a difference between horror and gore. Horror is the original exorcist , a combination of tension, frightening scenes, and a excellent story . I think of the original alien movie . That was scary .This movie is about shock and gore . Not scary at all .The reason people were piling is because they drank too much . It was one theatre full of teens and they were drinking and got sick . It was a screening .Anyhow it's a slasher movie that is gory not so scary but off putting . If you want to be truest scarred watch the original exorcist or alien .\",\n",
       "  'The first Terrifier, despite that \"scene,\" was brutal and scary in that 80s slasher way. I had no idea how brutal or anything about this movie going into it. In the end I wasn\\'t a huge fan of it, but it was well-done for what it was.This movie is just gross and boring. It\\'s like Hostel/Saw, after the initial shock of the \"torture porn,\" it\\'s just gross and exhausting to sit through. There\\'s no plot beside main two brother and sister having a father that predicted the events inside a sketch book. Having no plot for a slasher movie isn\\'t a bad thing, but when you throw in elements like the sketchbook, \"clown cafe\" or the female clown.... You want some answer?The after credit scene is just hilarious imo how anyone can find this movie scary is beyond me. It\\'s like a live action episode of Itchy and Scratchy.Anyway, the hype is unwarranted. There\\'s signs of creativity and I think if they expanded that instead of trying to find new ways to gross people out, this would have been a better movie.',\n",
       "  \"I saw a screener and while grateful, this is meant to be seen with a group of people. The fact they've managed to get theaters to agree to show it feels like a hilarious troll job. I guarantee you it will be yanked within a week or 2, unfortunately. Dolts who sleep with the closet light on after seeing something like The Conjuring will absolutely lose their minds. People will feel violated and theaters will cave in. The same thing happened with Hatchet 2 and Hatchet 2 isn't even in the same stratosphere as this movie.Utter insanity. An absolute freak show, in the best possible way. It's dark. It's hilarious. It's cruel. It's like the first one but twice as drunk and dealing with paranoid schizophrenia and a crack habit. I mean that as a compliment.\",\n",
       "  'On Monday 29th August (a bank holiday in England), the Cineworld at Leicester Square, London was completely packed for this film. They\\'d turned the air-conditioning on a bit too high, which gave the film an extra edge.This film is very gorey. The screening today was Fright Fest (a festival for horror films), so we all loved it. I would definitely not take anyone squeamish to see this. Art the Clown has a particular thing for harming eyes, probably because he knows that we\\'re particularly squeamish about them. He also plays around with the brains and hearts of his victims. He often kills people just because they\\'re there, even if they\\'ve not done anything to offend him.A common criticism of the first film was that the plot was typical of the slasher genre, with teenage girls in trouble and the goody-two-shoes being the Final Girl. The plot is much better this time. I can tell you what each of the characters was doing with their time, before Art turned up, and there was a good thread on the father of Serena and Jonathan. Knowing that they\\'ve lost their father makes you feel sorry for them and want them to succeed. In the first film, part of me thought that it\\'d be funny for Art the Clown to win, but I really wanted to see him get vanquished in this one.I have some reservations. It is too long, being about an hour longer than the first film. The supernatural element is also a bit muddled. In \"All Hallows\\' Eve\", Art was clearly supernatural. In \"Terrifier\", you could just about believe that he was human, except for right at the end. In this one, there are supernatural things throughout, but there\\'s never any rules established. I know that film-makers like to keep audiences guessing, but the guessing game is more fun if we have clues to go on. The magic in \"Terrifier 2\" feels a bit too random to make you wonder what\\'s supposed to be happening.Still 8/10 for the pure horror, despite those reservations.',\n",
       "  \"I really liked Terrifier One. Art the clown was an interesting mix of childish buffoonery and over the top violence that switched in a split second.Terrifier Two is basically a typical slasher film where it's clear they plan to make this a franchise like Hallowenen or Friday the 13th.Unfortunately the plot is idiotic and makes ZERO sense. The first half shows very little of Art and focuses more on a family dynamic of mother, daughter and son. About midway -- during the party -- it takes a nose dive into Art but it just is not compelling in the slightest AND it doesnt fit with reality. It is basically a random bunch of scenes pulled from other slasher movies. And an after credit ending, setting up the sequel, that is ludicrous.And Art has lost all his charm. In the first film his violence was complemented by his impish pantomimic charm. Hes lost all of it in the movie. And BTW Terrifier has now become a dark ride.Also they throw in this other running character that appaears to be supernatural or fantasy and again, it doesnt fit. It's just stupid.Then there is the nearly 2.5 hour running time. Way too long for a slasher movie. And you can tell they padded scenes with dopey dialog to get the running time up. Folks, this is not a Marvel movie. It's Art the Clown. 90 minutes is sufficient.And finally, I don't buy the hype that's going around saying people were throwing up, fainting, and so impacted by the violence they had to leave.The violence is really no different than what we saw in the early slasher movies of the 70's 80's and 90's. If anyone was leaving, it's because the movie is pretty terrible.HUGE disappointment.\",\n",

This movie was utter insanity.Some of the most brutal death scenes ive ever watched in a horror film...there were parts where I literally said \"jesus christ\" out loud in the theater. They dont turn the camera away you see it all.Complete gorefest its amazing.Now the plot is pretty weak and makes no sense and its a little long to be a slasher but to me that doesnt hinder from the actual spectacle of the film which is the gore and practical effects.If youre looking for a good storyline and plot youll be pretty disappointed. But if you want to see just mindless death and absurd over the top gore this is highly recommended!',\n",

Honestly haven't had a movie make me yell in disgust and look away but at the same time keep watching because the make up and everything is really good. Art the Clown is ruthless and doesn't ever hold back. Never speaks either but yet you know what he's saying. Final girl is Amazing!\",\n",

Easily one of the most gruesome horror films I ever seen I don't know how they make it seem so real special effects/ practical effects had a football field size of dead bodies for the film. A lot of memorable scenes and madness; it's a very cool movie despite the flaws. Felt like nightmare fuel throughout I wonder how Damien Leone came up with such morbid filled horror. Lastly at the theater when finished there was ambulance and police for someone that passed out during Woman King I hope everything is ok at the Stonecrest theater in Charlotte.\",\n",

This is the way horror movies (or any movie for that fact) were meant to be seen. Not stripped to the very core by some board or committee that's supposed to be the judge of what you should or should not be able to view as a grown adult. They should be forced to submit a letter of apology to Tom Savini for years of butchering his FX work. If they don't think kids under a certain age should be able to see something fine, but don't punish those involved with edits or threats of X ratings. Honestly as a kid, it used to make me angry then too. Anyway, horror fans should absolutely see this insanity. Sure it's mindless, it's brutal, and a little dumb at the end, but it's about an un-killable psychotic clown, what do you expect. How this got into theatres, I have no idea, but it's hilarious that it did.\",\n",

Super long mid credit scene so stick around for that. I thought the original Terrifier was about a 7 out of 10 and I would give all hallows eve a 6 out of 10 on a good day but this is a solid 9 there's really not much they could do to make it better.

The attempt at creating a background story turns out to be totally laughable by the end. Have not seen a two hour long slasher thriller before this.However, the kills are so extreme that they would make your hair stand on end. Many viewers reportedly vomited during the screening and it is easy to see why. The amount of blood spilled and mass torn is at the highest end of gore spectrum.At a budget of less than a million and a collection of almost 3 million, this seems to be a winning formula for the studio.Makes for an unpleasant, yet truly memorable, watch because of the inventiveness of cruelty.',\n",

My son liked it but he's 17, yes it was his turn to pick. I think about 200k of the 250k budget was spent on fake blood and the cleanup of said fake blood, if I have to say a positive the gore effect work was decent to good. The rest is expected, there isn't a story, the acting is comparable with a middle school play, and the last 20 minutes just slips into the bizarre nonsensical.

Will the gore and guts and acid attacks and split heads and shotgun blasts to the face scar me for life? No. Will the interminability of this movie scar me for life? Maybe.

       "  'With practically double the runtime of the original film, Damien Leone\\'s \"Terrifier 2\" sets out to be a more lengthy, ambitious, and terrifying movie than \"Terrifier,\" the film that started it all through the memorable introduction of a new horror icon in Art The Clown. And while the first movie wasn\\'t the most creative, with a light on story and high on violence approach that never differentiated itself any further from your ordinary uber-gory slasher, the character of Art managed to capture the attention and imagination of viewers and critics alike. The silent, but incredibly animated and expressive, mime proved to be a beloved villain through the juxtaposition of his quiet demeanor but loud actions - as they put so succinctly in this film, \"For a guy who doesn\\'t speak, he sure makes a lot of noise.\" Art\\'s shenanigans continue in full force here, giving audiences more of what they expect, but maybe not exactly in the way they expected - \"Terrifier 2\" improves upon its predecessor through its more complex plot, especially as told through its character development of Lauren LaVera\\'s character, Sienna.A two hour and 18 minute run time is nothing to sneeze at, and director Damien Leone knows this - so he wastes no time in introducing the carnage that audiences expect from Art. Opening with a bloody bang, the film engages immediately, giving viewers just a taste of the madness that is to come. But where the first \"Terrifier\" keeps its momentum through a cat and mouse style rampage that features Art mutilating and murdering everyone in his path, \"Terrifier 2\" slows things down after its explosive start. With an actual plot this time around, contrasting against the original\\'s more proof of concept style, \"Terrifier 2\" takes its time to build plot development through elongated dream sequences and true to life conversations, especially when it comes to the character of Sienna.\"Terrifier 2\\'s\" final girl, Sienna finds herself face to face with evil itself in the form of a psychotic clown. And you\\'d think that a basically all good, morally upright character would be a distraction from the film, but her good nature personality actually enhances the goings on, as she is a lawful good protagonist to contrast against Art\\'s chaotic evil. Lauren LaVera was incredible in the role as a fierce heroine who can certainly stand her own against a formidable opponent - I can see her compared to characters such as Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode, and her showdown with Art was endlessly entertaining and narratively satisfying. But alas! If you\\'re watching \"Terrifier 2,\" you\\'re watching it for the over the top violence and gore - so let\\'s talk about it.When it comes to slasher film blood and guts, \"Terrifier 2\" is the real deal - I can\\'t remember the last time I saw a movie this violent in theatres. Art rips people\\'s eyes out, chops people\\'s heads off, flays people alive, and scalps people, just to name a few things; if you are at all squeamish, you should not see this movie. However, if you enjoyed the first one for all of its darkly comedic brutality, you will certainly enjoy the upped ante here. All of the violence is disgusting and hard to watch, but it\\'s all being done by a highly animated and over-exaggerated clown, which makes even the most horrific crimes bizarrely entertaining. You\\'ll find yourself having a sort of sick smile on your face as Art makes his mark, and while you might feel yourself feeling guilty, you can\\'t help but think that the movie is relishing in its carnage as much as you are.\"Terrifier 2\" is a fun movie - it\\'s by no means high art, and I don\\'t think it is a classic by any means, but Art is certainly a horror icon and watching him in action literally never gets old. While more ambitious than the original, the plot still lacks real narrative heft besides, \"There\\'s an evil clown, and someone has to stop him.\" That said, the simplicity really does give way to some incredible horror set pieces that I will have burned into my memory for a long time. If you\\'re a fan of the first film, or even if you\\'re not and you are simply a fan of horror, you have to give this one a watch.',\n",

But it's just a brutal, mean, dirty, hardcore blood bath. Definitely beats out Hostel in the gore aspect, but idk if it beats Hachet 2 & 3 or The House That Jack Built...But mannn, some scenes felt like a Snuff film since the quality and budget was a little low.

As well as all of this they have a female lead that is acted well, written well, and delivers enough punch to make the audience root for her. Really well done guys. Good Job with this one.I'd watched Halloween Kills a few days ago, what an utter disappointment that was, this perked me up a little because it showed that creators are still out there that are willing to give the audience what they want. This is certainly a little more supernatural than the previous rendition, but that's fine by me as it's carried off with just enough cheese to make it what it should be. Reminded me a lot of the golden days of horror in the 80's and early 90's.

       "  'The trailer for \"The Woman King\" would have you believe that the film is one constant, nonstop action romp. Alas, you have been misled! But what else are Hollywood marketing departments for than to trick potential viewers. More of a talky drama and less of an action extravaganza, \"The Woman King\" tells a revisionist, alternative history of the fierce Dahomey kingdom. I am no historian, so, when walking into this movie, I knew literally zero of whatever the true story may be; instead, I simply desired a film with an engaging plot, and well-shot action sequences. \"The Woman King\" has none of those to offer.For a film that advertises the brutality of its characters, \"The Woman King\" is surprisingly bloodless. With action scenes filmed in the typical close-up shaky camera style, this movie, in terms of its action, offers up nothing that you haven\\'t already seen before, and seen done better. During large-scale battles the camera shakes, as if the cameraman himself is having a seizure; the violence is censored and neutered, with a lot of the kills occurring offscreen - because a movie about slavery just has to be dumbed down to PG-13 to become family friendly! Film is a business, after all.Luckily, you will find some entertainment value - or at least I did - when viewing the culture of the Dahomey tribe. I can\\'t speak to the historical accuracy of what the film portrayed, but I do enjoy movies that show in such detail the culture of people who lived long ago, so I certainly enjoyed the various traditions and rituals that were shown on screen. Alas, I do have a complaint when it comes to this, though: What I thought would be my favorite part of the film, the military training, almost seemed like an afterthought with it taking up only a small amount of screen time. What, then, did the film focus on? Mediocre melodrama.With actresses that act so well you wonder if they were preordained for success in the film industry, \"The Woman King\" boasts Viola Davis and Lashana Lynch, two women who consistently give powerhouse performances. And while their performances are well done in this movie, the problem lies in the fact that \"The Woman King\" has a weak script. Instead of telling a straightforward story about fighting back against slavers, for some reason the movie decides to add plot threads (including an underwritten and unbelievable romance) that I, frankly, didn\\'t care about. So while I enjoyed the acting, I couldn\\'t help but feel taken out of and bored with the movie since the storylines never really grabbed me - a lot of it felt like it was taken out of a comic book or graphic novel, complete with a revenge subplot that was borderline unnecessary in a movie that was already about seeking revenge against those who have enslaved them.A crowd pleaser through and through, \"The Woman King\" is receiving both critical and general audience acclaim; with an A+ rating on Cinemascore, I\\'m sure that most will walk into and enjoy it for the historical epic that it is. However, the bloated plot, weak script, and worst of all, the watered down, unfulfilling, and incomprehensible action kept me from fully finding entertainment value in this movie because, as I often say, when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks. And while \"The Woman King\" doesn\\'t suck, it\\'s not nearly as good as it would have you believe.',\n",
       "  \"I saw the two glowing reviews here and decided to write mine. I watched the movie today at the cinema and I was left with a slight feeling of disappointment.First off, the story is engaging and the the plot progression isn't bad. But something just felt missing.The trailer is a bit misleading but I won't spoil anything here.Let me start with the bad; the title gives the impression that Viola Davis is the central character but this is not so from what I saw, not really.Thuso Mbedu's character seems to be the protagonist here and her delivery is nothing short of amazing.Lashana Lynch is equally phenomenal as a supporting character, even outshining Davis.As for John Boyega, his outing as the young king is one or the best things about this film. I didn't know the actor had such charisma.Generally, the acting is good, especially from the aforementioned actors.Nigerian born actor Jimmy Odukoya is a great villain who wasn't given enough screentime.I believe the character would have been phenomenal if his backstory had been explored.The cinematography is below par (I have seen Nollywood movies with better camera work) but perhaps the biggest letdown is the action.The fight sequences came off as really disappointing as it was easy to see that it wasn't real combat despite the impressive choreography.The romance was forced and written in such a way that at the end of it all, I asked myself why it was there in the first place.The musical score is sublime and the songs and chants got my attention.At the risk of being bashed, I will end my review by saying The Woman King is a good movie that should have and could have been far more.\",\n",
       "  \"The Woman King (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres last night. The storyline follows an African kingdom with a new(er) king in 1823 who posses the only female army in Africa. The leader of the female Army has a past that haunts her but the respect of her king, enough to be on his council. She strongly urges him to avoid the slave trade and find alternative methods of riches. Meanwhile, those who do believe strongly in the slave trade look to march on the kingdom and bring them down. A new recruitment class to the female army brings brashness, new ideas to defend the kingdom, and the female leader's ghosts back to the forefront...This movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball) and stars Viola Davis (The Help), Thuso Mbedu (The Underground Railroad), Lashana Lynch (No Time to Die), Sheila Atim (Doctor Strange: In the Mouth of Madness), John Boyega (Star Wars: Episode VII-IV) and Jimmy Odukoya (Mamba's Diamond).This movie has so much depth and contains a great primary plot and even better sub plots. The writing is remarkable, thorough and very impressive. The character's inner demons are well portrayed as is their struggle to overcome them. The acting is out of this world across the board. You feel for every character; and if anything happens to anyone, you feel personally hurt. The villains were also excellent as is the outcome of each of them. The settings and cinematography is outstanding and there is impressive use of lighting. The action scenes are remarkable and the fight choreography is award winning caliber. My only complaint is an awkward love story that is obviously in here to show maturity and self discovery but I could have done without it.Overall, this movie has literally everything you'd want in a movie - tremendous action, great villains, self discovery and character triumph. I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing this movie and score it a 10/10. We loved it.\",\n",
       "  \"LIKES:The Plot: A plot like this has the potential to be too extreme or get lost in one factor that everything else tumbles. Thankfully, The Woman King has succeeded on many fronts with a successful presentation. While nothing revolutionary that we haven't seen before, this film really takes a tired story and sharpens it into a spear of many elements that pulled me into the mix. The battle for slavery in the colony days holds many horrors and the movie really shows how one can make a film about fighting the horrors without going Disney on it. Amidst the overall plot are various subplots that focus on the kingdom aspect, which though not fully fleshed out like Game of Thrones, again holds great management with the time they have, establishing a good pace. It forges a community quite well, and that is the central pillar for this film to work with.The Character Focus/Utilization: Much of the story's strength comes from the fantastic character focus of the story, and utilizing many people in the right amounts. True, Viola Davis is a main character, but the writers and director managed to extend the stories to other warriors that help give you more characters to attach too. Outside the woman warrior components, other factions hold their own merit, such as the King himself by Boyega, the evil ruler of the opposing empire, and even the love interest that forms later on in the movie. While not the most balanced, it again, keeps the components very well involved and helps spice up the tale we've heard so much.The Cultural Aspect: Taking those characters and throwing them into a cultural tale was a brilliant choice for me. The Woman King will give you plenty of tribal activities to study and adore, finding themselves potentially captivated by the community's use of song, dance, chanting, and other rituals. Some might be hard, boring, or boastful, I'll admit that when they get a little long, but overall, very impressed with the cultural integration piece to establish the setting.The Music: Another immersive element, this movie's film score holds two primary styles that might help get you into the setting they designed. No surprise, there is a lot of what sounds like African Tribal music to the works, the drums, shakers, and a few horns helping to give you that stereotypical sound the Lion King made famous for many of us. It works very well in the cultural settings and sometimes extends to other moments that describe the pain well. My favorite was the orchestral work, and there are moments where the theater's system amplify that sound to a very, very, high degree to sell that epic moment. Great use of music.The Acting: No surprise, the movie has done very well to make the characters come to life in ways I had hoped they would. Not quite in your face feminist and tough, as many things choose to do, this tribe kicks major butt in the female led cast. Lynch is probably one of my favorite characters in this story, her balance is nice to see, and she shows so much in her ability to extend across emotional spectra to make a very realistic character. Young actress Mbedu crushed her role as well, getting a lot more spotlight than I had anticipated, but for the most part gets her acting down pat, including hysterical cries. I quite enjoyed her determination, but again the fact that she was not perfect was an incredible display of direction and restraint to again make fun characters. Of course, Davis is the star of the show and no surprise, she crushes it again. In what might be my favorite role of hers, at least in a while, Davis unleashes the tough woman attitude she wields so well, but then manages to pull some it back and open up her vulnerability. As the movie goes on, she may not cover quite as many levels of emotion her compatriots do, but somehow takes her angle and makes it work so well given the position of her character. Needless to say, but I will anyway, the chemistry is top notch and that's the successful part of all this ordeal is how well they work together.The Costumes/Make Up: We aren't turning the women into orcs, elves, or donkeys, but they are transforming them into the tribal warriors of a kingdom. This film's use of costume and makeup is subtle, looking like something from a play, but again works so well in what it accomplishes. I loved the warrior looks, I loved the settlers rugged clothes showing struggle, but entitlement, and I loved the makeup evolution deepening on the scene as it brought those cultural moments to life for me.The Setting: Small shot at this, but wow were the shots beautiful of the coast and plateaus of the kingdom. I'm not sure about all the set pieces and CGI work given the blend to this film, but the cinematography at moments is breath taking to see the world to such a degree as what they got.The Action: By far my favorite part of the movie, the action of this film proves for the most part that we still have directors who understand dances of death. The Woman King has at least four action scenes I would call worth it, with a few micro moments to fill in the gap. In these moments, you get different feels for the moment, and the variety works very well to give these moments more of a reason than what many actors do. And in almost all the fights, the choreography is insanely good, with acting, moves, and stunt work blending together to really give the warrior's edge. I loved so much about this movie's battling, especially the epic fight about 75% of the way through the movie and feel that the bar is raised again for action choreography to follow.DISLIKES:A Little Scattered: The movie's plot is not perfect though, and like so many films requires more time to really capitalize on all the stories they tried to tell. The Woman King jumps around a bit at times, with several transitions diluted, or limited to these quick asides that in the grand scheme of things did very little to elevate the story. Not being mean, but so many stories does often lead to incomplete usage and there were potential stories that needed more fluff.John Boyega's Accent: It's a bit cheesy, it's a bit forced, but that doesn't mean I hate it. Boyega does his best with the accent given, and it's not as cheesy as some might have you believe. However, there were better ways to take the character if I'm being honest.The Villains Are A Bit Simplified/Extreme: What this means is that the Woman King's great character development arc did not extend to the antagonists of the film quite as well. Where Nanisca, Nawi, and Izogie hold so many layers to them, the other guys are just simply extreme bad guys that are lightning rods of hate to put your ire against. In addition the stereotypical moments really shine in these characters and I had liked more time to give them some depth given the power they held.Some Hard To Watch Moments: Pertinent to the story? Yes they are, but that does not make some of the moments easy to watch if you can't handle the unfortunate truth of those times. Sensitive fans need to prep themselves for some hard to watch moments that might make the bile in your gut rise. I won't say much, but you've been warned that some details might be hard to watch.The Final Fight is Poetic, But Not As Climactic: After the amazing fights and usage of the story elements, the final fight was a little bit of a letdown for me if I'm being honest. Sure, there are great moves at times, and there is a bit of edge to the madness, including some awesome moments of justice. But that fight before it was a thousand times better and I had liked a little more f that same coordination to make it feel like the film had not been rushed. Again, it has its own element and feel, but that last fight with so many things happening could have used a touch more time and planning for me to really call it the fantastic end it deserved.The VERDICT:\\nThe Woman King had a lot of potential to be another political movie, but what I got was a great balance of many things that just needed more time to be perfected. While female led, there are plenty of other characters with side stories that work together quite well. It's a movie that pulls culture, visuals, costumes, and acting together to really create the tribe you expect to see. And the pacing of the tale, especially the utilization of action, might be some of the best I've seen in a very, very, very, long time. Sure, handling so much resulted in some stories not having the same kick I wanted to see, and there are shortcuts taken to compact it to 120 minutes like it wanted to do. However, the movie really did make a great theater experience for me and is worth the trip if you've got the time. My favorite movie of the three I watched, this reviewer gives The Woman King:Action/Drama/History: 9.0\\nMovie Overall: 8.0-8.5.\",\n",
       "  'The Woman King is a scintillating portrayal of powerful women protectors driving change in one of world history\\'s most pivotal and often heart-rending times: the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Yet even through the beautifully-filmed and well-choreographed battle scenes, moments of love triumph and make this film worth watching.Set in the 19th century in the West African kingdom of Dahomey, The Woman King follows the all-female group of warriors, the Agojie, and their general, Nanisca (Viola Davis) as they fight, not just against the rival Oyo and Mahi tribes, but foreigners who wish to destroy their way of life and take their people. Along the way, Nanisca must grapple with her past... and Nawi (Thuso Mbedo), a young girl among the ranks of the Agojie who turns out to shape Nanisca\\'s future.Director Gina Prince-Bythewood outdoes herself. Beyond being a film that does its bit to rectify historical exclusion of African narratives in Hollywood, The Woman King is a superb crowd-pleaser, with familiar thematic beats of moralism, love, and community and a fresh-enough take on the \"historical war film.\" The sets transport viewers to pre-colonial Benin, and the cinematography, especially the use of light (inside the palace barracks) and color (the earthy tones of Dahomey\\'s villages), further enhances the viewing experience. The background score by Lebo M. And Terence Blanchard draws on traditional West African music. It\\'s simply goosebump-inducing to watch the Agojie charge into battle accompanied by soulful singing and the djembe and marimba. Good Lord - can Viola Davis do no wrong? The highly-proclaimed actress is perfect for the role of the ruthless, defensive, protective leader; the emotional depth Davis taps into is frankly impressive. She hits all the notes - trauma survivor, bereaved mother, sister in arms - impeccably. Davis\\' character\\'s more conservative, regimented, typically \"top brass\" attributes are beautifully offset by Thuso Mbedo\\'s portrayal of Nawi, the newest recruit who seems to challenge every rule so carefully enforced by Nanisca (and isn\\'t afraid to confront Nanisca as an \"arrogant old woman\"). Nawi and Nanisca\\'s relationship flowers in a way that will make viewers say \"aww\" and though the two tussle every so frequently, the duo becomes the most lovable part of the film - a tough contest. A close second favorite is Izogie (Lashana Lynch), a more experienced member of the Agojie, who is equal parts hilarious, profound, and sweet. My favorite line of Izogie\\'s is essentially, \"We all have a lot to cry about; it is better to laugh.\"The Woman King promotes liberty, staying true to yourself, standing up for what is right, keeping your head held high (but your arrogance in check), obeying authority while also making wise decisions for yourself, and protecting those you love. Nanisca fights against King Ghezo\\'s (John Boyega) vision to sell their prisoners of war to the Europeans for guns and other \"valuable\" goods, acting as a strong voice against racism and the commodification of humans.I give The Woman King 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The Woman King releases in theaters on September 16, 2022.By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!',\n",
       "  '9.5/10Amazing. Spectacular. Breath-taking. Endearing. Empowering. Inspiring. Purposeful. These are just some of the words that come to mind to describe this film.While I found \"The Woman King\" to take a long time to get to a point. There was reasoning behind that time. It\\'s a slow, methodical build-up to an incredible story of strength, endurance, love, and loyalty. There\\'s an excellent story to be told here, and there\\'s no reason it should be rushed to tell it.Every time I saw the trailer for this film I thought two things. First, I\\'m fired up to see it. Second, it looks and feels very much like \"Black Panther\", which I wouldn\\'t be surprised if there was inspiration drawn somewhere.The acting was incredible. I never think about awards when watching films, but I am hoping that Viola Davis wins \"Best Actress\" for her incredible performance. I also hope the film gets an award for \"Best Score\", as the music is its own living thing. It had me tapping in my seat, and feeling the moment as it happened on screen. In addition to Davis, I loved seeing the performances of Lashana Lynch and John Boyega, but also everyone chosen to play in this film embodied their roles to perfection.This film has definitely landed itself in my top three of the year, and perhaps even my number one! Everyone will have their own judgement on the film, but I hope you feel as much of an incredible story and adventure as I did.Overall, this film is 100% worth seeing in theatres. It\\'s a fierceness that transcends a normal story about warriors. It\\'s about a tribe that stands up and fights for what it believes, and finds inner healing along the way. I truly believe one award nomination will be given to this film.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!',\n",
       "  \"Can take nothing away from the acting performances here, Viola Davis is phenomenal, but I'd expect nothing less from her. The problem is, she's a bit underused. I went in expecting her to be the lead character, as shown in every Trailer and movie poster, however she's eventually relegated to a secondary role. Boyega does a pretty good job as well; one of his better performances.My major concerns are with the direction and cinematography. Camerawork looked very amateur, and the action sequences (outside of the splits from the trailer) are very underwhelming.This could've been an 8 or 9 with a better director. But unfortunately, I'd have to give it a 6/10.\",\n",
       "  \"Viola is the only recognized name but she doesn't dominate the screen time, and that's a good thing. While Voila has her own storyline, many of the characters have their own storyline. The overall story is unique as it starts with the local tribal dynamics, and not countries. It also touches upon a subject that has been given very little publication time, and that's African's participation in the global slave trade and misogyny. Pretty solid acting, enunciating and timing with just about all the characters; both many and few adding to the overall depth of the movie. Personally, I don't think it's Braveheart and Black Panther as much as more of a person's painful past determining their path, and that goes with a lot of characters; not just Viola's. Coordinate that altogether and you have one fine movie.\",\n",
       "  \"Hollywood really needs to be released from the clutches of whoever decided on the so called African accent, never heard it before and it irritated me all movie long. I left the movie feeling conflicted, heading into it I thought it was going to be an exaggerated showing of black excellence or female power, it sorta was but this was more carefully portrayed. It was adrenaline pumping with a lot of action that was spread out to allow time for story and plot. It's slightly predictable though because the characters had threadbare personalities hence easy to read, once they were given an introduction you could deduce a lot of how their stories, hence the movie's as well, were going to unfold.It should have had a higher rating than pg13 though, because even though there was a lot of bloody fight scenes there wasn't much blood or gore; the fights were well choreographed so I'm not complaining much, the gory could have just made it better.As I said, the accent really annoyed me, other than that Viola Davis put in another strong performance, one of which we've become accustomed to by her so that was great casting. John boyega and Hero Fiennes Tiffin too, the latter with a role not usually associated with him. Lashana Lynch had the same problem as her previous roles were she slightly overdoes the tough guy role but the internet rushes to her defense claiming it's people who just don't like a strong black lead or something.If you think about it, it's not a story you haven't heard, only thing setting it apart is it's based in Africa during slavery and for that will probably get a cult like reception from some due to the message it carries, breaking chains and all. Not perfect but still pretty decent and worth a watch.\",\n",
       "  'This movie was very different from what I expected and pleasantly so too. There is so much talent packed into this 2hour movie and it is very obvious all the people involved put real effort into this. Being Nigerian myself, I appreciated the real effort put into sounding like we do....the mannerisms, the accents, the clothing....it was all beautiful. I understand a bunch of funny people are hung up on the fact that this movie isn\\'t \"historically accurate\". Please remember this isn\\'t a documentary. It\\'s a beautiful story told in spectacular fashion. Lovely cast, lovely cinematography. Please watch this at the cinema. It\\'s worth it.',\n",
       "  \"I saw The Woman King, starring Viola Davis-the DC super hero movies & tv shows, Ender's Game; Thuso Mbdeu-The Underground Railroad_tv, Scandal!_tv; Lashana Lynch-No Time To Die, Captain Marvel and John Boyega-Breaking, the Star Wars movies.This movie is inspired by true events and takes place in the 1800's in Africa. The Agojie were the King of Dahomey's elite, all female warriors/guards. John plays the King of Dahomey and Viola is the general in charge of the Agojie. The African tribes would raid other tribes for men, women and children to trade them for goods from the Europeans, who would then take their slaves away in ships. Viola tells John that she has had enough of the slave trading and wants to stop using the people and instead, trade in other goods. Lashana is a fellow Agojie and Thuso is one of the new recruits. The Agojie's training and tests are shown and after they graduate, you can see why they had the reputation of being so fierce in battle and could put a whooping on most men they encountered. There is a short scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for violence, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.I thought it was interesting and I would buy it on DVD.\",\n",
       "  \"Despite this movie having a basic plot description for what happens in this movie, trust me when I say the story for this movie is incredible. The story of this movie doesn't just tell this story of a female-led army but serves up two different purposes. The first purpose of the story of this movie is to help bring light to this piece of history. Before this movie came out or even the trailer how many people actually knew about this kingdom and army? Probably not many people who aren't from that area of the world or from the culture. This is why this story is so incredible because even though most of what you're seeing is false it still makes you want to look up and learn more about the Dahomey and the Agojie. The movie's story does a great job of hocking the audience along for this journey and showing just how badass these women were. This brings me to the second purpose of this movie's story which is to show and empower women to be warriors. Recently Hollywood has been getting better at showing stories of women as more than just a side character and The Woman King thankfully joins those ranks. This movie does not hold back when showing how tough these women are in comparison to the men and it's amazing. Due to this movie having a majority female cast it wasn't the hardest task to show how strong women are and especially show younger girls how strong they can be. Another part of this movie's story I really enjoyed was the African culture it included. I have to admit I'm not the right person to talk about African culture so I can't say how accurate it is but it was still interesting to see it included in this movie during the downtime between action scenes.But despite the incredible story of this movie the pacing for this movie is kind of weird. From the beginning of the movie to the end there is no clear passage of time so it's hard to tell how much time has passed. One second they're training the new recruits and the next it's the final test for the new recruits. This really isn't a big deal and doesn't take away from the movie as a whole but it kind of irks me. I would've loved to have seen them training more and seeing how they become to be these mighty warriors instead of some of the other scenes in this movie that easily could've been cut down or out of the movie and nothing would've changed. But it was hard to tell there were pacing issues when the acting for this movie was spectacular. Obviously one of the biggest names that's in this movie is Viola Davis, who plays Nanisca, and man does she steal the show. Viola Davis plays this no-nonsense leader who just cares about the people in her army while still showing some vulnerability. It's incredible to see her switch between being this serious leader and then showing vulnerability when she's around her closest friend. Another actress who stood out to me was Lashana Lynch, who plays Izogie. Lashana Lynch at first appears like she's going to be the comedic relief for this movie and in some ways she is but she also brings some humanity to this movie as well. With Izogie she shows how somebody can be this tough person on the outside but still be caring to those close to her. The last person I want to shout out is Sheila Atim, who plays Amenza. She doesn't get much screen time unfortunately but whenever she was on screen she was great. All of the actors in this movie did amazing jobs and helped bring the audience into this compound. I just want to quickly say if you ever get bored while watching this movie and Hero Fiennes Tiffin, who plays Santo Ferreira, is ever on the screen keep count of how many times he breaks his accent because trust me it happens quite often.With this movie being an action movie the pressure is on for the action scenes to be good and thankfully the action scenes in this movie kickass. All of the fighting in this movie is so well choreographed and knows how best to show off the strengths of each character in combat. The most impressive part of the action scenes is the knowledge that the actors all did their own stunts which helps bring the audience into the fights as well. What also helps with fight scenes is the framing and directing of the scenes to make sure they're easy to follow and Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director, did just that. The action scenes still had some edits put in to change the camera angle but you can tell that the directing for those scenes was to make them as clean and in focus as possible. But it wasn't just the fight scenes the directing was great during but the movie as a whole was directed so well. You can see how much passion Gina Prince-Bythewood had for this project and how she wanted to make sure the story was told and seen. Before I wrap this up I just want to rapid-fire shout out some other elements I loved from this movie due to how much it dived into African culture which are the costume designs, production design and the music, done by Terence Blanchard. In the end, The Woman King might not be fully truthful to the real Agojie army but this movie does an incredible job of making people want to learn about them. This is an important movie to check out, especially for women and probably will be an award-season favourite.\",\n",
       "  'It\\'s been a minute since my last trip to the movie theater, there just hasn\\'t been anything that sparked my interest. A sentiment apparently not just my own. The manager at my theater of choice told me they\\'ve been opening late in the day since there hasn\\'t been anything to draw folks in. I fully expected this to continue to be the case unit at least next month until I stumbled across an Instagram post by Viola Davis for The Woman King about a 19th century elite group of female African warriors. Real life Dora Milaje, not only starring but also produced by Davis and her husband? No doubt I HAD to see this film.The short and sweet of it? The Woman King is an exceptional movie.Period.Superb acting lead by the incomparable Viola Davis is just the start.Rising star Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Lashana Lynch match Davis\\' power, ferocity, humanity, and emotion creating the heart/soul/core of the film. Their chemistry and interaction are mesmerizing and the solid foundation that the film is built upon.Dana Stevens and Maria Bello\\'s script is rock solid and perfectly encapsulates all the strength, warmth, humor, pain, triumph, joy etc. That so many \"female\" based stories tend to lack and services both the story and actors beautifully. The richness this script has is a true rarity.Having Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball and The Secret Lives of Bees) in the director\\'s chair is an added bonus. The opening sequence had me glued to the screen and I couldn\\'t look away the entire film. Fair warning, the action sequences are brutal and glorious, completely unwavering in their ferocity.The cinematography, musical score, sets, and direction all on point. The layering elevates the entire viewing experience.The Woman King is not just 2 hours 15 minutes of Viola Davis and company kicking ass (thought that wouldn\\'t be a bad thing) it\\'s a grown up, character driven triumph that transports viewers to pre-colonial Benin in a fresh take on historical war films. I can easily risk over hyping from my own enthusiasm, and risk underselling for fear of saying too much. So, I say, if you have the slightest interest in this one, just go. The Woman King needs to be seen/experienced on the big screen. It has all the feels, powerful messaging, and humanity/community we can all use right now.The Woman King is a 10.',\n",

       "  'James Lipton once asked Chris Rock during an episode of Inside the Actors Studio if he would explain the use of the N-word in Black culture to his audience-prompting Rock to look back at him with the terrified wide-eyed response of, \"Now I got this job!?\"A similar sentiment surely haunted everyone involved with The Women King, which attempts to tell a 19th century African story to a multicultural audience. The film has received plenty of scrutiny already, both from people skeptical that it could offer an accurate portrait of Africans\\' role in atrocities and those looking for a beacon of light to be shone on a misunderstood people and their history.\"I knew what it would mean to us as Black people,\" said the film\\'s star, Viola Davis, in an interview with Vanity Fair. \"Something that has never been done before. And what it would mean for Black women sitting in that movie theater. The responsibility is high.\"The Women King rejects the notion that its responsibility is to teach African history in two hours. Instead, it tells a tale of pride, dignity, and agency against the backdrop of the fascinating Dahomey tribe. In short: With a stellar cast, filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood (who wrote for A Different World and directed Love & Basketball and The Old Guard) brings the legendary Agoji warrior women to life.Davis does an amazing job of playing Davis, without ever seeming to embody the persona of a stoic African warrior. Lucky for the film, this hardly matters. The sheer force she brings as an actor provides the essential emotional beats that a more authentic portrayal might have asked her to sacrifice.Meanwhile, the supporting cast of fellow warriors accomplish an astonishing amount of characterization through slight looks and limited dialogue that distinguish each of them within the unit. But the breakout star is the young Thuso Mbedu, who plays the headstrong recruit Nawi.At the beginning of the film, Nawi is a teenage girl being married off by her caregiver. Vigorously resistant to the choice being made for her, she\\'s sent to live and train with the Agoji warriors, where she is to take no lovers and bear no children (it\\'s not unlike joining the Night\\'s Watch in Game of Thrones). She\\'s stubborn, but her desire to be a warrior drives her through brutal trials-and helps her become a proud warrior.Set in 1823, The Woman King finds the Dahomey in a cyclical conflict with a neighboring tribe, enriching themselves with the sale of each other\\'s prisoners to the international slave trade-and King Ghezo (John Boyega) of the Dahomey is being pressured to abandon the practice.The tribe\\'s most passionate advocate for forsaking the slave trade is Nanisca (Davis), the general who leads the Agoji, which is Ghezo\\'s fiercest fighting force. Her previous experience in slavery traumatized her to the point of clarity, convincing her that the Dahomey must break from the system they\\'ve chained themselves to before the tribes devastate each other.The brutality on display in the tribal war is measured. This is PG-13, after all, and that may be the one thing holding The Woman King back from being an epic, as opposed to merely a very good film (the filmmakers seem to have chosen accessibility over a fiercely accurate, R-rated depiction of war and slavery).This is in line with Roland Emmerich\\'s \"historical\" Revolutionary War film The Patriot (2000). Both movies use loosely tied-together backstories within an authentic setting, while shoehorning an egregious love story into the plot (again, chalk it up to the accessibility factor).The Woman King sidesteps the accusations of its loudest prerelease critics, who demanded that all warts be shown in its depiction of the French and African tribes and the slave trade. The trailer elicited quite the backlash from people who claimed that the film would depict the \"noble\" Africans murdering their \"evil\" white oppressors.Not so much, it turns out. In The Woman King, the Africans are shown with relative historical accuracy concerning their own brutal war tactics, slavery for profit, and attitudes towards women. And as for the French slavers, they\\'re not demonized beyond the understanding that the slave trade existed.In other words, The Women King is directed at a Black audience, but it\\'s a movie for everybody. And if its existence causes people with racial animus to inadvertently study African history? Cool.Ray Gill Jr-Willamette Week.',\n",
       "  \"The movies weaknesses are some of it's technical aspects. The direction is just ok and the editing at best does it no favors. The fight scenes in particular were essentially uninspired and typical, and over edited. For the first third or so, I couldn't always make out a word at time like the sound mix was bad, though could always be the theater sound system itself. I also felt the runtime a bit, which for a guy who loves The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Rober Ford is saying something. Maybe lose 15 min, mostly 1 unnecessary sub plot. The aforementioned editing didn't help in this area either.It looked like much of the outdoor photography at least was shot Africa, big plus. The actors are all in. Boyega nails his part without overdoing it as a king. The main warrior women are interesting and very distinguishable. All did terrific jobs and sell being great warriors, especially the ones playing veterans. They all seem invested and help make the movie worth it.Big positive: if you're looking for a movie going for woke points, this isn't the movie for you, meaning go see it. You'll learn something. The main conflict is dealing directly with the internal problem of Africans slave trading other Africans. It's the main point. Even the 'good guy' tribe is dealing with having sold its own, and are the good guys because they desire to turn from that path, not because they are unrealistic flawless idealists.The white slavers do play a small part, and are Portuguese slavers from Brazil; another welcome touch.The realistic way they dealt with the issues is the film's saving grace and it deserves to be seen to show Hollywood that black actors deserve more than to be randomly chucked in as Achilles or Nordic chiefs for social points. Plus, negatives aside it is pretty good and worth seeing. Give this film your money, it deserves it.\",\n",

       "  \"Overall if you haven't seen this movie and are criticizing it for slavery depiction or feminism ect.. you need to watch it. It did a brilliant job of NOT bringing in political modernism and telling the story of this tribe which has women and men warriors unlike other tribes that just focused on men and its story from the year 1823 (when they were at war with other tribes & such) The balance was really great.Slavery: they talk about it. They condemn it. The tribe does it and talks about how they have done it. Viola Davis character talks about how they need to stop doing it. The movie does NOT glorify or shy away from the brutality that it was.History: there is a beautiful article explaining the history inine with the movie with historians. Look up: time the woman King true story.Anyway it was a good movie that made you care about all the characters and forget about the time.\",\n",
       "  \"Genuinely excellent. Films that are written, directed, and especially acted well enough to earn tears and cheers should be forgiven of historical inaccuracies and small narrative missteps like the romantic subplot. This is a modern story for a modern audience, particularly an American audience, and that should also be taken into account when we consider historical accuracy. As an emotional power-ballad about the strength of black women and the need to fight for honor, respect, and virtue, this film rocks. The entire cast is superb, the emotional climaxes are earned, and the film's heart is in the right place.\",\n",
       "  \"It is an interesting thing to rewrite history so that the power is given back to the people who were introduced to the cycle of slaving and being enslaved by countries that would oppress them and destroy their development for centuries to come. The movie encourages some of those conversations, and while it's a little clean, it doesn't shy away from what it is. Anyone who is frustrated by the adaption, is hopefully also frustrated at all of Tarantino's adaptions which do exactly the same thing.A great action movie, featuring a mostly black-female cast, and helmed by a black woman, which is almost never seen in this capacity. Well worth the watch.\",\n",
       "  'If The Woman King\\'s only issue we\\'re the fact that it presents itself as a \"true story\" yet is about as historically accurate as Space Jam, that would be one thing. (I\\'ll get to this later.)Unfortunately, aside from the committed performances from most of the cast (especially Viola Davis), this is also one of the clunkiest narratives I\\'ve seen put to screen in some time.The romantic subplot is rushed and entirely without substance or feeling. The central young woman Nawi supposedly has a traumatic past that we are barely told about, and she has no character growth at all. She wants to be a soldier, so she does. She\\'s arrogant and disobedient at the beginning of the film and continues to be like this to the end.Davis\\'s character Nanisca has an arc-at least on paper. She is emotionally closed off due to trauma and then decides not to be. But this change happens within two minutes of screen time and occurs off screen. It\\'s kind of hilarious how unearned it is.The story has no actual fleshed-out antagonist. There are a couple of villainous persons but their goals are vague at best and cartoonish at worst.All this could occasionally fall to the wayside if the action sequences were good. But this film has some of the worst action I\\'ve seen put to film this year.Nearly all of the fight scenes are exceptionally clumsy in how they\\'re shot and edited. Far more often than not, the shots consist of our heroes swinging at someone off screen or so visibly for away from them that it\\'s obvious to anyone with functioning depth perception that no actual strike took place.Equally as often is the occasional shot in which the enemy soldiers literally-and hilariously-just patiently stand there waiting for the good gals to come take them down.Okay, now for the elephant in the theater: the insulting historical \"basis\" for the film.For a movie that wants to bemoan the evils of colonialism, the filmmakers really are colonializing the culture of nineteenth century west Africa.How? By paving over the Dahomey\\'s centuries-old historical acts of human sacrifice and voluntary brutal enslavement of both their own and foreign people. The writers slap their 21st century feminism on top of a historically brutal culture and call it a day.In reality, the Dahomey would have scoffed at the idea of ending the slave trade, as they only stopped trading slaves in the mid-19th century because the British forced them to stop. But this film depicts most of them as freedom-fighting abolishionists and acts as though the slave trade didn\\'t exist until Europeans invented it. This is nonsense.Imagine if there were a film made today about the American civil war in which the confederates were portrayed as freedom-fighting abolishionists who had slavery forced upon them by the north.This would be rightly condemned, so why aren\\'t people enraged at the convenient erasure of uncomfortable history that is propagated by this film?It\\'s a largely incompetent piece of filmmaking, and it\\'s an insulting, culturally offensive piece of writing.It\\'s shameful.',\n",
       "  \"When I went into this movie, I already knew very well the history surrounding the Agojie and the actions done by the African kingdom of Dahomey. But because I've almost always appreciated and liked the roles that Viola Davis chooses, I gave it a try.After Viola Davis declarations about what it would mean if people didn't went to see the movie, a big part of me wanted nothing more than to not even see the movie. But I took her statements, as her making a huge mistake, that might hurt an actual good movie.And as it turned out, I wouldn't have lost anything if I hadn't watched this movie.From Viola Davis, to Lashana Lynch Izogie and others. The performances were for the most part solid, and the natural beauty of the African continent all helped to make the movie tolerable.However try as they might, and they did try, history didn't happened that way. Not exactly. The Woman King gives you the Hollywood edited version of history, but it doesn't give you the actual history. The ugly side of the tribe that Nanisca (Davis) is portraying.It's understandable why they did what they did, seeing the times they were living, and the movie should've owned that, instead of trying to embellish the truth. Anyone with an ounce of common sense would've understood, or at least tried to understand what was happening historically in that period of African history.But apparently they are too ashamed to own to their own history. Maybe because the actresses and actors, didn't even bother to study the history of what they were going to be portraying.The movie is not good, not really. It's watchable, not just because of the performances but also because of the beauty of the African continent, and also in part the culture as well. However they could've cut twenty minutes to the movie and you'd have lost nothing.It has too many moments that are slow paced, and then it just puts in the fifth gear and doesn't slow down. To the viewer that doesn't know anything about what they're watching, they might be deceived into thinking they saw a a movie about female empowerment, and how to fight against oppression to preserve one's freedom. Because that's what the movie tries to sell.And it's really because of the embellishment of a hard reality, that was the reality of those times, that I couldn't really appreciate this movie. It would be like applauding inaccuracy for the sake of creating a nice story, instead of owning the truth and show how many times sacrifices and hard choices need to be made.I completely understand how some people might be more than willing to close their eyes to those things, but the dual standard isn't lost considering other historical movies were also a target of great scrutiny. And if memory fails you, then remember the criticism done about Kingdom of Heaven for not accurately portraying the Islamic side of history.So if all other historical movies have been subjected to critic of their historical accuracy, then The Woman King doesn't get a free pass. At least not from me.And then there's the story of the movie itself. Completely predicable from beginning to end, some of the dialogues were cringe as cringe can be, and some actresses like Viola Davis tried to sell their roles so hard that it came out as far over the top.Twelve Years a Slave was a great movie, however The Woman King is not. It's watchable in a way that you can see it and pass the time, but without ever getting pulled into the story.This movie will add nothing to the career of the actresses and actors in it. And it will add little to viewer, that spends the 135 minutes watching it.And so there's no doubts, this movie lost me because a) the story wasn't good enough b) the story is too predictable c) some performances are just too over the top and d) the historical inaccuracy is unforgivable.\",\n",
       "  \"There is a real need and thirst for African 'origin' stories in Hollywood. And quite rightly so. It appears to me that every black lead at the moment is either there to shoehorn themselves into an originally white cast role to tick a box, or a role where being black is their entire personality. Sometimes that's important, like Hidden Figures, or The Help, but should hardly be the standard. People of colour deserve their own stories. Hollywood is just lazy to be frank. But to take a tribe that were notoriously bad as warriors, and noted as incredibly happy to sell people into the slave trade, probably was as an ignorant miss as you could get at this time. They are famous for losing the majority of their battles, and participated heavily in the slave trade. But this movie paints them as proud black defenders. Which is not true. Which a descendent later apologised for. Which is a shame because i love Viola Davies.\"],\n",

Highly recommend watching this in a theatre if it's playing anywhere near you.

       "  'Greetings again from the darkness. I seriously doubt that I\\'ll ever skip a Cate Blanchett movie. She\\'s won two Oscars and has been nominated six times. She\\'s consistently the best part of her movies, and often the best in a full year of movies. Here she stars in the first film in 16 years from the remarkable writer-director Todd Field. His two previous films, LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) and IN THE BEDROOM (2001) combined for eight Oscar nominations, and more importantly, established Mr. Field as a rare and unique filmmaker of great depth. Having Field reappear and cast Blanchett generated a heap of excitement from this film nerd.Ms. Blanchett stars as Lydia Tar, a piano virtuoso, the conductor of the famed Berlin Orchestra, and a true musical genius. She\\'s a rare EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) from the classical field. Her music (and her life) is a quest to uncover/discover what the composer meant with each piece. Lydia is sometimes rough on her wife Sharon (Nina Hoss), but frequently dotes on their young daughter ... while otherwise living a relative selfish and self-centered life. We also see this true persona in how she treats her young assistant Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who quietly aspires to become a conductor, while efficiently keeping Lydia on track each day.The film begins with \"New Yorker\" writer Adam Gopnik interviewing Lydia as a stage presentation in front of a live audience. It\\'s his introduction of the Maestra where we learn her background and the proficiency that has garnered her such respect (as well as jealousy and animosity). Throughout the film, many real musicians (past and present) are referenced, and that detailed research is alone enough to earn respect for what Mr. Field has accomplished here. The stress and laser-focus on Lydia as she prepares for the final symphony in her Mahler portfolio (his 5th). We witness the meticulous detail that goes into managing the music and musicians, and this leads to handling the dismissal of veteran who is slipping, and the addition of a brilliant young cellist named Olga (Sophie Kauer). We are never quite sure if Lydia\\'s attraction to Olga is limited to her skills with the bow.Of course, any perfectionist at the top of their industry is subject to backlash and criticism. Is Lydia abusive? Is she exploitive? It seems the answers may be affirmative, and likely what drives her art. It\\'s quite discomforting to watch as she covers her tracks after the suicide of a former pupil, but I\\'ll admit to a certain feeling of satisfaction as she verbally spars with another student over gender semantics ... actions that of course come back to bite her.Ms. Blanchett is fascinating and mesmerizing to watch. She is at the top of her game playing a perfectionist who is at the top of her game. However, it\\'s clear this film isn\\'t likely to strike the right notes with mainstream audiences. It\\'s an arthouse film about art, and thus is filled with dialogue and much less actual music than you might expect for a film about a world class Orchestra conductor.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.',\n",
       "  '\"I am Petra\\'s father...I am going to get you.\" Lydia Tar (Cate Blanchett)Make no mistake, Tar is not about music: It is a fiction about naked power in the rarefied world of classical music conducting. As writer director Todd Field deftly orchestrates a drama that\\'s almost a thriller about the first female conductor, Lydia Tar, in a major German orchestra, the audience is thrilled and mesmerized as if Leonard Bernstein (her mentor) were conducting Mahler in Lincoln Center.Cate Blanchett brilliantly becomes Tar, a world-renowned conductor, who has had stints from Cleveland to New York and finally Berlin. Blanchett is great enough to make the audience feel as if they had been intimate roommates with the maestro.No longer having to answer questions about gender, she commands with like a dictator from choosing orchestral leaders to changing a program to feature a potential lover soloing Elgar on a decidedly-different program dedicated to Mahler.When she dresses down a student at her Julliard lecture, she also handily deconstructs Bach\\'s Prelude in C Major. She reveals in one incident her shredding personal side and her transcendent understanding of classical music.As the quote above displays, even in her personal life she exercises an outsized fearsomeness. She can dispatch her daughter\\'s (Mila Bogojevic) bully with a force equivalent to conducting Mahler\\'s Fifth (or \"the five\" as Lydia comfortably refers to it).When she asks permission from the orchestra to mount the Elgar, she is actually telling them that\\'s what the program will be, at the same time informing them she\\'s had to rotate out a beloved long-time player. Everyone is aware of the politics, especially her lust for a new cellist specializing in Elgar\\'s Cello Concerto, replacing her assistant, Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who has seniority and maybe better skills. Yet Field, clearly schooled in Greek tragedy, loads the screenplay with hubris, the poison of numerous power players over the centuries.It\\'s the conductor\\'s old game in new times when social media will reveal peccadillos as well as crimes, real or figurative, and autocrats like James Levine and Lydia Tar cannot withstand the scrutiny.Because we have lived through all kinds of strong-man rule, from democracy-endangering fascism to indiscriminate pandemic, unfettered power seems eventually doomed to the moral demands of a populace chafing at the abuse of leadership for its personal gain, be it wealth or lust. It just takes a while for Nemesis to arrive.Tar may be the best film so far of 2022 and Blanchett the best actress. Start your Oscar adventure now in theaters with Tar.',\n",
       "  'I believe that people in positions of authority should be held accountable for their actions. I believe that terrible people can make miraculous art.

I believe that 99% of people accused of misdeeds are guilty to some extent of those misdeeds. I believe that there are many people who seek to avoid engaging with complex ideas and perspectives that challenge them and make them uncomfortable. I believe that everyone is guilty at times of making sweeping generalizations about others. I believe that there are positive things we can learn from people who might be terrible in other ways.

Maybe all of the above. Maybe none of the above. The beauty of \"Tar\" is that it raises a host of complex questions but doesn\\'t force any answers on the viewer. This is a movie made for adults that lets us think for ourselves. A lot of people are interpreting it as an examination of cancel culture.

I don\\'t think it\\'s as much about the rights and wrongs of cancel culture as much as it\\'s about our complicated relationships with artists and the art they create.

I didn\\'t love it, though I liked it a lot. There\\'s something slightly cold about it, so while I enjoyed the intellectual rigors of it, I didn\\'t feel very emotionally involved. I started to feel its length as it moved into its final scenes.

It almost feel like she might be based on real person but she's not. Film is also about being a artist and power dynamics. Such a nuanced approach.Of course film would not have been this way, if it hadn't for Ms Blanchett's impeccable performance. I think she has even elevated the previous work by playing this character.

The dialogue is PACKED with references to classical music artists/works/history/etc. Not to mention there are constant little allusions to different plot threads which make up Tar's whole story.However, this dies down gradually and the movie becomes much more focused and simple. Blanchett is incredible, but not in a showy way at all. Her conducting moments were awesome. The story is political and relevant, and handled very well and balanced-like.There is a surprisingly creepy vibe to the film, that borders on something almost like a horror movie at times.

Lydia was selfish at times and remarkable at being professional; at the same time she heard random sounds at night or during a run I believe her work consumed her Cate Blanchett extraordinary for everything.

       "  'Lydia Tar seems to have it all. As she is introduced in an interview that opens the film, she is music director of a prestigious Berlin orchestra (and the world-leading female conductor), music composer, winner of the EGOT, and founder of an institute to train female conductors, etc. At home, she has a female partner, and together they are raising a child who is fond of her. But some past incidents come to haunt her.Cate Blanchette is mentioned a lot in earlier reviews for her acting, and I agree that she gives an excellent, believable performance in the role. However, there is more than acting that goes into a film. There is the story.One thread running thru the film is her rehearsals of the Mahler 5th Symphony. This is supposed to be her crowning achievement in recording, completing the full cycle of 9 Mahler symphonies with the same orchestra, in a covid-delayed live recording. I assume that the 5th was chosen for plot purposes, rather than a larger one with requirements for a choir, and also short enough to require a companion piece. Again, I assume for plot purposes, the selection of a companion piece was delayed until rehearsals for the 5th were almost complete, rather than being programmed a lot earlier, and a soloist (if needed) hired.As a donor to my local symphony, and so a seasoned attendee at rehearsals, I find the rehearsals authentic. That includes decisions like tempo, the balance between sections of the orchestra, and moving the opening trumpet solo offstage. Intriguingly, when Tar speaks to the orchestra in German, subtitles are omitted, which somewhat parallels the experience of being at a rehearsal, since the audience does not hear all of what the conductor is saying.At over 2-1/2 hours, the film is long, but reasonable. There is a sub-plot showing a different part of her world collapsing on her. Move importantly, her character has time to develop to show that the accusation against her are credible. There are mentions of real-world conductors being fired for sexual improprieties, but casting all-female principals nicely strips the gender differences away, leaving it to simply power and opportunity.',\n",
       "  \"Director Todd Field is up to something with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very.The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik. The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I coul;d not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations.

She calls her self a \"father\" to the little girl she shares with her partner, but doesn\\'t show much interest in her except for the opportunity to scare the hell out of one of the girls\\' classmates for bulling her little girl. Lydia, linda to her family, gets rid of anyone around her who is an inconvenience or perhaps annoying. The director todd field keeps everything moving along, balancing a lot of balls in the air at the same time. He leaves much up to the audience members to figure things out. Will she get her comeuppance? You\\'ll have to see for yourself.',\n",
       "  'Lately, I\\'ve been trying to enter into movies as unspoiled as possible--no trailers, no reviews, no news. This strategy has greatly improved my enjoyment of movies, I think. In the case of TAR, I went in knowing that it was about a controversial female conductor trying to put together a difficult symphony. I also, for some reason, was convinced that it was based on a true story--an illusion that the film itself in no way dispelled. Was it unusual to be seeing a biopic about such very recent events in the life of a living person? Sure. Was it refreshingly bold that the film seemed to hold no punches in its portrayal of its real life protagonist? Absolutely, but that seemed to fit what Lydia Tar would want. I imagined her giving her full endorsement to a film that exposed both her phenomenal talent and her most despicable flaws. Was I confused by the apparent artistic license that director Todd Field must have taken when choosing to reveal intimate private details that contradicted what was being told to the public? Sure, but this is art! Was it a bit mind blowing that I had never heard about some of the newsworthy events in the film? Well, yes and no--for one, I kinda remembered reading about that climax in The Atlantic last summer, and for another, well, what the hell do I know about the world of classical music? I can\\'t tell you the name of any conductor, living or dead, world famous or not. For hours after seeing the film, I had no idea that it was not a fairly accurate account of real recent events.Todd Field has created a masterpiece. The world he has captured feels utterly believable. The jargon-laden conversations, so frequently peppered with charged opinions about esoteric ephemera; the complete lack of anything that feels expository or explanatory; the magnificent embodiment of these characters by Cate Blanchett, Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant, and the others, so evocative of real lived emotions and back stories and contradictions; the atmospheric realism to every setting, prop, and costume: everything about this film seems suggestive of nonfiction, as though Todd Field and the other filmmakers were able to convey this international ecosystem of elite musical performance so convincingly because they were simply copying details, interviews, and footnotes that already existed. It is simply astounding that this screenplay is an original creation; its level of immersive realism surpasses anything else I can think of.The cinematography by Florian Hoffmeister, the editing by Monika Willi, and the work accomplished by their sound team likewise contribute to this impressive illusion. The camerawork in the opening scene so effectively places us in Lydia\\'s New Yorker interview with the real life Adam Gopnik as he enumerates the many accomplishments on her CV that the enunciation of her bio becomes a hypnotic spell ferrying us into the alternate reality on the screen. Other scenes capture gestures, tics, expressions, and glances that add infinite subtext and subversion to what is happening on screen.Towards the end of the film, a 1958 recording of Tar\\'s mentor Leonard Bernstein explains to us \"what music means\" and how it\\'s infinitely more layered and meaningful than our verbal communication. This is illustrated throughout the film, showing a woman of humble beginnings who has mastered not just English but apparently several vocabularies and yet often uses those precise words to conceal, to obfuscate, to abuse, to disorient, and to terrorize. Most of what she says often comes across as inauthentic, dishonest, pretentious, or performative except when the subject is musical expression, which she truly seems to intuit and love. At times, you\\'ll want subtitles to fully understand her hypereducated and superspecialized speech; if you can\\'t keep up, it\\'s only proof that she belongs in the ivory towers and you do not. Sometimes literal subtitles are needed (and not always provided) to fully understand the multilingual conversations, although the sense of the language can be appreciated simply from the sounds and delivery. When Tar tosses out ten-dollar words like \"misogamist\" in the midst of an argument in order to simultaneously belittle, confuse, and derail her opponent, one sees the ways in which education can be used simultaneously as a weapon and as armor. Beneath her venomous loquaciousness cowers an insecure frailty. Ignore the mask, the identity, the performance of self, Tar seems to beg--only the music matters.That is, in fact, her literal argument in one very captivating scene early in the film. During a screed against identity politics, she effectively asserts that art must be separated from the artist--a stance which the remainder of the film then troubles to the utmost. The movie engages in the cultural politics of today with full complexity, refusing easy answers or the clear taking of sides.There is a lot to unpack in this beautiful, artful, and provocative film. I imagine many audience members will be turned off by its many discomforting choices: forcing us to watch and acknowledge the full credits of all the filmmakers in the crew before beginning the movie, making us empathize with a protagonist whose actions are often contemptible and unforgivable, forcing us to keep up with allusions and references that are often unfamiliar, tantalizing us with glimpses of moments that have no clear purpose or meaning within the structure of the film, and then denying us any of the obvious catharsis that we\\'ve come to expect from our character arc-driven movie structures. Nevertheless, this is a rich, powerful, and moving film that I will certainly be revisiting many times.',\n",
       "  '. . . everyone involved spark waving mad. If you\\'ve seen AMADEUS, you already know about the giggling gargoyle. Rock-man-on-off drove a pianist nuts in SHINE. LISZT- kicked off World War Two in his -MANIA flick. Wagner\\'s crazed descendants married into the Fuhrer\\'s family. I seem to recall that the Shoe-man\\'s both went bonkers. BLACK SWAN illustrates the dangers of overdosing on Tchaikovsky. Shrinks are still arguing over whether lead in his pipes or V. D. in his plumbing drove Beethoven\\'s Tenth over the rim. A sane person trying to savor a Bach\\'s Lunch with Toccata & Fugue in D Minor blaring on the speakers will inevitably toss their cookies. If you\\'ve played second fiddle in an orchestra like me, you\\'re well aware that all the \"First Chairs\" are Loony Tunes. So TAR is simply the latest expose to document that too many cellos spoil the soup. From the opening conversation, it is clear that the baton twirler wench is a couple lug-nuts short of a safely-mounted wheel.',\n",
       "  \"Todd field who's amazing filmmaker, brought to us this gem starring complicated nuanced character Lydia Tar, played by none other than one of the greatest actor of all time Ms Cate Blanchett.I don't think I have seen character from cate since Carol. Her ability to walk between theatricality and subtlety is so pitch perfect, it almost feels like you are beholding something so spectacular. I think that's why Cate Blanchett is such a master as she show knows precisely how to tap into character without looking gimmicky. I can't imagine any other actor or actress playing this fictional character but cate.Todd field's dazzling and unabashed, uncompromised character study, makes him such a filmmaker. He made her character so compelling that it's hard ignore her, as Todd and cate are not interested in making this character sympathetic. Just to shows cinematic endeavours of these artists. TAR will be critical darling, astounding performance by cate Blanchett. Maybe it's her best.\",\n",
       "  \"Her performance is a tour de force! Right from the opening interview, I found this movie mesmerizing. The information about other composers and conductors is endless. Supporting cast is also amazing. I didn't give it a 10 because of the turn the story took at the end. After being taken on a wonderful, brilliant journey, they destroyed her character. To what end? What was the point? All brilliant artists self destruct? I left the theater disheartened. The other reason, I marked it down is because they made you sit through ALL the credits at the top of the movie. Considered leaving but thankfully, the movie started.\",\n",
       "  'I went to this movie with great anticipation. As a classical music devotee, I was also anxious to see how it figured into the narrative. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic in an Oscar-worthy performance, and other actors are fine as well. But good acting in a bad film isn\\'t enough. The film is a tedious, pretentious mess, and worse, for the first two hours, it\\'s boring. (For someone who knows or cares little about classical music, it must be painful.) Short scenes interspersed within the narrative are neither meaningful nor symbolic-- they just go nowhere and feel like self-indulgent artsiness. We learn much about Tár\\'s ascendency to the top tier of her profession (as if someone is reading her Wikipedia page to us) but learn nothing about why Tár is the miserable human being she is. If it\\'s simply meant to be a portrait of an unlikeable, imperious, narcissistic, and cruel personality, it generally succeeds. If it\\'s a commentary of \"me-too\" and cancel culture, it\\'s superficial at best. If we\\'re supposed to care about her or her life, it fails. James Levine--been there, done that.',\n",
       "  \"TÁR first awes us with Lydia's elegance and acumen, cows us into submission to her intimidating intellect, before beginning its investigation into what that reverence has allowed. When does a person's brilliance, so potent and singular, curdle into a kind of aggression? Lydia-a close acolyte (and imitator) of Leonard Bernstein in this movie's version of history-is perhaps at the vertiginous top of her field. Bad habits can develop in all that alienating esteem.Gradually, TÁR gives us clues about what's going on just outside the film's close gaze. We receive snippets of information about one of Lydia's past proteges, a troubled young woman who has become an insistent nuisance scratching at the impervious majesty of Lydia's life and career. There are brief, unnerving sequences in which we view Lydia's apartment and Lydia herself, asleep on a private jet, through video captured by some unseen person's phone. Text messages on the screen suggest a sneering disdain for the great master. Lydia is being watched, reconsidered, maligned. There is a fissure somewhere in her sterling reputation that, as the film sumptuously unfolds, cracks open into ruin.In somewhat reductive terms, TÁR is a film about the recent wave of #MeToo-adjacent accusations that have brought down titans in many industries, but especially in the arts. Lydia Tár becomes just such a figure. Field's film-ruthless and grimly funny-builds toward a mighty, but not entirely conclusive, reckoning. Field nails the fraught tenor of this very contemporary discourse, both its urgency and the fear (mostly shared by those on, or adjacent to, the receiving end of accusations) that some line has been crossed into overreach.TÁR ultimately has no pity for Lydia's trajectory, but it does perhaps quietly mourn for the art-bemoan the corruption of something good at the hands of ego and entitlement. Field's film is enormous, contemplating the end of idolism in all its loss and revolution. TÁR bracingly responds to the dawning of a new era, and reintroduces the world to a filmmaker who seems only better for having taken some time, a very long time indeed, to listen and to learn.\",\n",
       "  'As far as I am concerned she could read the damn telephone book and win an Oscar. As prior reviews, Cate slays it and with no imperfections. This role was definitely tailored made for her and Todd was right only she could pull off all the learning the musical instruments, conducting and all the technical savvy in being a conductor. Bravo Bravo she is easily a shoo in for another Oscar nomination not to mention her 3rd Oscar win. Especially on her learning German kudos. It was just a tad long but took a little while getting to the root of why the subject matter turned disturbing. What a ride!!!',\n",
       "  \"This is a slow burn movie but it is not boring thanks to the out-of-this-world acting by Cate Blanchett and an amazing supporting cast including Nina Hoss. Todd Hayes' screenplay is ingenious and I am still thinking of the movie after watching it last night. People who say if you are not in the music world then you will be bored watching this movie, they are completely wrong. The central message of the movie is about abuse of power and cancel culture and music and orchestra are just an instrument (no pun intended) to deliver the main theme of the movie. Go see it on the big screen! Blanchett's acting will amaze you. Way above any other actor with a movie release this year, male or female.\",\n",
       "  \"It has been quite some time since a character study became so engrossing for me. And it is without question Cate Blanchett's transformative performance that creates this effect.Tár is a film that refuses to tell a conventional story. It takes a VERY long time for it to become clear what the film is actually about, because rather than introducing us to a world and the characters in it, Todd Field puts us right in the mind of an artist and then shows us the things that shape her psyche.No doubt many viewers will find their patience tested to its absolute limit by the elusiveness of the film's purpose. I personally found it riveting, as the dialogue is so sharply written and Lydia is such a fascinating character to dissect from scene to scene.Simple conversations and events are presented to us that do not have any apparent impact on the narrative in the moment. Not until the film's conclusion do the film's many happenings collectively boil over into their tragic and profound purpose.Ambiguity is further compounded by the refusal of Field to give us concrete answers regarding the moral implications of his story.Is Lydia a good or bad person? Was she guilty, and if so, to what degree? Did she deserve her unfortunate fate?These questions have no definitive answers, nor should they. It amplifies either the ironic justice or the ironic tragedy of the narrative, depending on how you look at it.The only complaint I have is the length. Yes, it is too long. Retrospectively, there were definitely some pieces that didn't belong in the puzzle and could have been cut to alleviate pacing burdens.What a colossal achievement of daring, fearless filmmaking. Cinema.\",\n",
       "  'It\\'s a psychological drama set in 2022, mainly in Berlin, Germany, but includes New York and Tokyo. It follows a world-famous female conductor working on finishing a cycle of Mahler symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic, for which she is the chief conductor.Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) was a prize student of Leonard Bernstein\\'s and has conducted all the major American orchestras. At the film\\'s beginning, we learn several things from an interview with Adam Gopnik (Adam Gopnik). Besides her great musical background, we observe that Lydia has stage fright before performances, but her iron will and quick wit allow her to suppress her inner stress. As the movie unfolds, we learn she is married to Sharon Goodnow (Nina Hoss), the concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic. Her assistant, Francesca Lentini (Noémie Merlant), is also an aspiring conductor and possibly a former lover. Lydia and Sharon have a daughter, Petra (Mila Bogojevic), who has some issues at school.As time passes, we see the darker side of Lydia\\'s personality. She humiliates a Julliard student who doesn\\'t like Bach and blocks out the suicide of a former student. Then, Lydia begins to manipulate the career of a promising young Russian cellist, Olga Metkina (Sophie Kauer), for her own purposes. Suddenly Lydia\\'s world begins to collapse and comes to a shocking climax and a somewhat less-than-believable and overly symbolic ending.The film opens with extended credits, which struck me as unnecessary. The story slowly unfolds, but with superb timing. Cate Blanchett is amazing and entirely believable as the complex Lydia Tár. Hoss and Merlant are also excellent. The remaining characters fill roles adequately. The functions of time and sound are significant concepts in the movie, but I thought the place of \"sound\" might be a bit overdone, though others may disagree.\"Tár\" is worth seeing for Cate Blanchett\\'s performance alone, but it\\'s also an outstanding story with only minor objections.',\n",
       "  \"I have seen movie two times.I just can't get this movie out of my mind. It's so cerebral, I don't think this movie would have worked with another actors but only Cate Blanchett.She exudes performance mixture of Blue jasmine, Phantom thread, Black swan, Women under the influence.Todd field is an auteur, dialouge rich screen play must have needed lots of deep research. I get why he only wanted Cate Blanchett to play this role. She's mesmerising, even if you don't get the lingo of classical music, she will suck you in her world with her charisma. This movie is really intelligently made and it does not spoon feed you or being didactic about anything even though there are elements like 'cancel culture', 'Metoo' etc. Exist in contemporary sociopolitical zeitgeist. It's a really clever filmmaking. Todd field really took some time and research as I said to make this masterpiece.Cate Blanchett's performance will reverberate in cinematic history for being one the greatest of all. She undoubtedly desereves another Oscar for this tour de force turn. Having also seen Michelle yeoh (EEOAO), Daniel deadwyler (TILL), Michelle Williams(The Fablemans), all incredible in their movies but Cate Blanchett really operating on another level that can not be matched, and it's not Hyperbole. Ms Blanchett really commands the scren, maybe that is why she's considered greatest actor alive, along with Daniel day lewis.Do give this movie a chance, you may find it slow at first but if you let it sink Inuit will take over.\",\n",
       "  \"Cate Blanchett's performance of a female superstar conductor is the reason to see the movie Tar. The film sinks us into the world of symphony. It's a learning experience (it was for me); engrossing. Think of the smartest person you know; say Einstein and look how messy the personal life can get. Do you want to now cancel him because you can with an edited video shown on the internet? Do you think it's right to abuse your fame to satisfy your ego without consequences? Would you like to see different outcomes? Is cancel culture the answer? Maybe. Lauer, Rose, Weinstein, Louis CK, Russell, Bonds, Soto, McGuire - all male versions of Tar. Hard to see such talent be reduced to less than what it was when it started. The missing piece here is apology and redemption. So even though we see Tar reduced to continuing her craft at a kind of country fair event (falling so far) it would have been more satisfying if she had voiced apologies to many she had hurt. Showing that even in disgrace, she felt remorse. Instead of hiding she decided to keep apologizing then going back to work with a new work ethic. That would have been a nice addition.\",\n",
       "  'After a 16-year absence from directing, Todd Field is back with the intellectual character drama \"Tár.\" Rapturously received at festivals and by critics in large part due to Cate Blanchett\\'s leading performance as Lydia Tár, the film has been extremely acclaimed. On the grounds of Blanchett\\'s riveting performance, I would say the acclaim is plenty justified. The rest of the movie, while well-made, skillfully composed and stylistically controlled, did not do quite as much for me as it did for many critics.Blanchett\\'s acting is superb as Tár. She skillfully exhibits an appropriate emotional range while simultaneously making use of an encyclopedic understanding of classical music composing, effortlessly switching back and forth between English and German, and commanding the emphasis of the viewer in nearly every frame of the film that she is in (which, of course, is the overwhelming majority of them.) Todd Field does an outstanding job directing her as well, creating an immersive and clinical atmosphere that may remind viewers--to some extent--of Kubrick. The main plot is primarily about the downfall of Tár, and the plot ends up significantly touching on the theme of so-called \"cancel culture.\" The film handles these themes with care, but could have done so in a more deft manner--and that delicate balance between cinematic carefulness and needing a tighter structure is a lingering issue in the entire movie. At 158 minutes, \"Tár\" is a long movie, but I am not completely certain that it fully justified its length. Field\\'s direction and command of the medium is highly commendable in a general sense, there are a lot of scenes that do nothing to advance the story, its themes, or its characters (such as Tár walking to the refrigerator, etc.) that cumulatively add up into a somewhat-significant amount of material that could have been better edited for the sake of conciseness. While the film is undoubtedly a character study (and a good one at that,) it still could have used a somewhat more structured plot to help complement Lydia Tár\\'s character development. The film\\'s slow pace and methodical, intellectually rigorous modus operandi will definitely not be for everyone. Yet while I didn\\'t love the film in its entirety quite as much as some, I still recommend this to discerning and sophisticated film lovers. 7.5/10.',\n",
       "  \"Cate Blanchett gives a historically-great, oscar-worthy performance. The movie is worth seeing for Cate's performance alone. If you're someone who identifies as a cinephile, you'll probably really appreciate this film. If you're looking for something entertaining, this may not be the film for you, especially because it runs quite long, around 2 hours and 40 minutes. Full marks for subtle and complex story telling, though I found the film unnecessarily opaque at times. My 7.5/10 is based on the following: 4.5/5 in terms of having all the elements of a good movie: writing, acting, etc., and 3/5 for entertainment value. An interesting aspect of this movie is its commentary on today's social climate.\"]]"
